	Amid fears of a decline in the country's GDP, former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh cautioned the people today that the worse was yet to come in the wake of demonetisation which he termed as a "disaster". **************************************************



	  **************************************************



	At a convention called by Congress on demonetisation, former Finance Minister P Chidambaram claimed there was no record of the Cabinet meeting of November 8 when the government had said to have taken the decision to withdraw Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes. **************************************************



	  **************************************************



	In his address at the 'Jan Vedna' conclave, Singh termed demonetisation as a "disaster" and said things were going from bad to worse and that the worse was yet to come. **************************************************



	  **************************************************



	He dismissed as "hollow claim" Prime Minister Narendra "Modi's propaganda" that things have started looking up. **************************************************



	  **************************************************



	The former Prime Minister said it was the "solemn duty" of all Congress men to tell the people the wrongs that have been done by Modi and that a "clarion call" should be given to the countrymen to "awake and rise" up in protest. **************************************************



	  **************************************************



	Both Singh and Chidambaram said there would be decline in the country's gross domestic product (GDP) because of demonetisation. **************************************************



	  **************************************************



	Chidambaram, in his address, said there is no record of the Cabinet meeting of November 8. "Where is the Cabinet note? Where is the Cabinet decision?" he asked. **************************************************



	  **************************************************



	He said that never before in India's history such a farce has been enacted. The former Finance Minister also said that the reputation of RBI is at risk today. **************************************************



	  **************************************************



	The government and the central bank generally have differences but never before a government has treated RBI like a department of the Government of India, he added. **************************************************



	  **************************************************



	He said that even one per cent decline in GDP will lead to a loss of Rs 1.5 lakh crore to the country. He said every challenge thrown by Modi government should be matched by the Congress with utmost courage and utmost wisdom. **************************************************



	  **************************************************



	"Only Congress party can stand up to this (challenge)." **************************************************



	  **************************************************



	The party also issued a statement at the convention that the Prime Minister must reveal what percentage of the demonetised currency notes was black money as practically all the demonetised notes have been deposited in banks. **************************************************



	  **************************************************



	"This exposes the hollowness of the government's claims. The PM is masquerading as a crusader against black money and corruption after having singularly failed in fulfilling his promises of retrieving the unaccounted wealth and money stashed abroad," it said. **************************************************



	  **************************************************



	The party said India's image has been tarnished by projection that the Indian economy was primarily based on black money. **************************************************



	  **************************************************



	"It is also a matter of concern that during the 50-day period of 'notebandi', an unholy nexus of certain corrupt BJP leaders, black-marketeers and bank officials were shown to be operating by various media channels, indulging in illegal conversions of stockpiles of currency," the party said. **************************************************



	  **************************************************



	It said for the corrupt black money holders, the back door of banks operated, while the common man waited for his turn in lines at front doors. **************************************************



	The BJP on Friday criticised the opposition Congress, BSP, SP and AAP parties for opposing the Narendra Modi government's decision to demonetize Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes, saying that they have "exposed themselves" by doing so. **************************************************



	  **************************************************



	Addressing a press conference here, BJP chief Amit Shah said he does not understand why parties like the Congress, Bahujan Samaj Party, Samajwadi Party and the Aam Aadmi Party, which were demanding action against black money, are criticising the demonetization decision now. **************************************************



	  **************************************************



	"I can understand the trouble and pain of tax evaders, terrorists, Maoists and others involved in black marketing, but I can't understand problems of these political parties...Why are they opposing the government's move to demonetize currency notes of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000," he said. **************************************************



	  **************************************************



	He proceeded to add that "these political parties have actually exposed themselves" by going against the government move. **************************************************



	  **************************************************



	"I want to ask them whether they are against black money or not. Congress, AAP, SP and the BSP should clarify this to the nation," he said. **************************************************



	  **************************************************



	Talking about the decision, the BJP chief said it was a planned decision and would throw out black money and counterfeit currency from the system. **************************************************



	Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi on Friday accused the government of not allowing him to speak in Parliament despite his speech being ready. He said an "earthquake will come" if he gets the opportunity to speak. **************************************************



	  **************************************************



	"For the last one month I want to speak in the Lok Sabha... want to speak what is in the heart of the poor across the country about demonetisation," Gandhi told the media here in the Parliament premises. **************************************************



	  **************************************************



	"If they allow me to speak in Parliament then you shall see that an earthquake will happen," Gandhi said. **************************************************



	  **************************************************



	The Congress leader alleged that demonetisation is the biggest scam in the history of India. **************************************************



	  **************************************************



	Hitting out at Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Gandhi said: "He is giving speeches across the country, but scared of coming in the Lok Sabha. Why is he running away from debate? They are not ready to sit in the Lok Sabha. What is the reason?" **************************************************



	  **************************************************



	"This is the biggest scam of India's history. If I say this inside the House, Modiji will not be able to sit. I want to talk about the biggest scam that has been orchestrated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, but I am being stopped from speaking," he added.  **************************************************



	  **************************************************



	Gandhi further said: "First they spoke about black money, then they spoke about counterfeit notes and now they are talking about cashless economy. Come and talk to us. They will talk, we will talk and people will get to know everything about demonetisation, who benefited from it, who is incurring losses and why was it done." **************************************************



	  **************************************************



	The government and the Opposition have locked horns over the issue of demonetisation during the current winter session of Parliament. **************************************************



	  **************************************************



	The government on November 8 announced spiking of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes to curb "black money and corruption". The spiking of the high value notes has led to a cash crunch across the country. **************************************************



	Opposition ranks in the Lok Sabha were boosted today with AIADMK members joining them in their noisy protest on demonetisation, as the government vehemently resisted their demands, including a debate under a rule which entails voting, forcing the House to adjourn for the day. **************************************************



	  **************************************************



	Amid noisy Opposition protests in the Well which continued right from the start, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Ananth Kumar insisted that the government was willing to debate every aspect of the issue and went on to cite BJP's win in the bye-polls in Madhya Pradesh and Assam to claim that people have endorsed the government's decision against black money and corruption. **************************************************



	  **************************************************



	Opposition parties like TMC and CPI(M) too have won in the bye-polls in West Bengal and Tripura, ruled by them. **************************************************



	  **************************************************



	Mallikarjun Kharge (Cong) and Sudip Bandhopadhyay (TMC) said they wanted a debate but demanded Prime Minister Narendra Modi's presence and that the Speaker admit their adjournment motion, which will result in division of votes and passage of a resolution, on demonetisation. **************************************************



	  **************************************************



	They received a shot in the arm when P Venugopal (AIADMK) spoke about "suffering of people" due to shortage of currency notes and said his party had also given an adjournment notice. **************************************************



	  **************************************************



	Opposition parties cheered as he spoke. AIADMK is perceived to be more sympathetic to the treasury benches on many issues. **************************************************



	  **************************************************



	"Government is willing to start a debate. I don't think that the opposition parties are in support of black money, fake currency and terrorism when the whole country is supporting the Modi government over its decision," Kumar said. **************************************************



	  **************************************************



	Kharge said they too were ready for a debate but wanted Modi's presence and that their adjournment notice be admitted. **************************************************



	  **************************************************



	Equating Speaker Sumitra Mahajan with a mother, he said she should hear them to which she retorted that a mother would want all her children to live together happily. **************************************************



	  **************************************************



	Like previous days, Opposition members trooped into the Well and began protesting as soon as the House met at 1100 hours. **************************************************



	  **************************************************



	The Speaker carried out most of the Question Hour amidst noisy scenes before adjourning the House briefly till noon. After laying of the listed papers, she adjourned the House till tomorrow as opposition parties remain unrelenting. **************************************************



	  **************************************************



	Members of Congress, TMC, Left parties, SP and AAP were demanding discussion on the demonetisation of Rs 1,000 and Rs 500 under Rule 56, that entails voting. **************************************************



	  **************************************************



	Congress vice president Rahul Gandhi was seen in his seat having an intimate discussion with AAP MP from Punjab Harinder Singh Khalsa.  **************************************************



	  **************************************************



	As members of Congress, TMC, Left parties and AAP wereraising slogans in the Well, NCP and RJD members stood in the aisles in solidarity with the other protesting opposition members. **************************************************



	  **************************************************



	AIADMK members were also in the aisles raising the issue of Tamil fishermen injured allegedly in firing by Sri Lankan Navy. **************************************************



	  **************************************************



	Ignoring the slogan shouting opposition members, Speaker allowed the Question Hour to continue amidst noisy scenes. **************************************************



	  **************************************************



	When some opposition members tried to bring a placard denouncing the demonetisation move in front of Minister of State for Home Kiren Rijiju, who was replying a question related to his Ministry, the Speaker tried to intervene and asked the MPs not to disturb the Minister. **************************************************



	  **************************************************



	"This is not good. Everyone will be shown on TV, but don't disturb the Minister. If you want to discuss something, raise it before the government. People are in pain, tell the government. But this is not the way to highlight people's grievances," Mahajan said asking them to return to their seats. **************************************************



	  **************************************************



	However, an unrelenting opposition continued to raise slogans. **************************************************



	  **************************************************



	The Speaker again appealed to the opposition members to participate in the debate saying that the disruption of proceedings would not solve the problem. **************************************************



	  **************************************************



	"I am really pained. If you are people's representatives, you should stand by them," she said. **************************************************



	  **************************************************



	Due to continued pandemonium, the Speaker first adjourned the House till noon, and after laying of papers for the day. **************************************************



	Claiming that people have been subjected to harassment and financial insecurity in the one month since demonetization, West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee today said the Prime Minister must clarify the situation to the nation and take entire responsibility for it. **************************************************



	  **************************************************



	She also claimed that 90 people have died due to hardships following demonetization of high value notes. **************************************************



	  **************************************************



	"One month of harassment, pain, hopelessness, financial insecurity and utter chaos," Banerjee said in a statement. **************************************************



	  **************************************************



	"That is all that the common people has got after the black decision on demonetization announced a month back on November eight," Banerjee, who has been the most vocal against demonetization of high value notes, said. **************************************************



	  **************************************************



	"PM must clarify the situation to the nation and take entire responsibility," Banerjee said. **************************************************



	  **************************************************



	Claiming that no black money has been recovered, the Trinamool Congress supremo said, "Only white money of the common people has been snatched away." **************************************************



	  **************************************************



	The TMC MPs have been staging protests in both houses of Parliament since the winter session began. **************************************************



	  **************************************************



	"Even no black money has been recovered from foreign countries. In the name of recovery of so called black money, the ruling party at the Centre has created assets in the form of land, bank deposits, gold, diamonds and has become more and more capitalist," Banerjee, who has led an unrelenting attack on the BJP and Prime Minister Narendra Modi over demonetization, said. **************************************************



	"One month since demonetization was announced. More than 90 lives lost. How many more Modi babu?" Banerjee said on twitter. **************************************************



	  **************************************************



	She said in her statement, "Production has nosedived, agricultural activities have been shattered, buying and selling is down drastically, the economy is in shambles - the entire country is passing through an unprecedented financial emergency. **************************************************



	  **************************************************



	"Untold sufferings have come down in the lives of farmers, labourers, workers of unorganised sectors, tea garden, beedi and jute workers, employed class, students, sick, old and infirm people," the chief minister said in her statement. **************************************************



	  **************************************************



	"The common man is helpless. Mothers and sisters have been forced to give away their small personal savings to run the family in the face of serious cash crunch." **************************************************



	  **************************************************



	"No one knows when this unfortunate ordeal will end. No one knows when good senses will prevail to stop this mindless harassment and sufferings of common people. No one knows what good has happened to the country and its people with this big, black decision," the chief minister said. **************************************************



	  **************************************************



	 Calling for immediate action to restore trust and confidence of the people on banking and financial sectors, Banerjee said, "People must have hassle-free access to their own money and feel secure that their money is safe with banks and financial institutions." **************************************************



	  **************************************************



	"We have raised the issue repeatedly in Parliament and in different other platforms. Leading economists have criticized this mindless demonetization. But there is no response yet," she added. **************************************************



	Amid a din, a bill which seeks to tax money deposited in banks post demonetisation was passed in the Lok Sabha today within minutes without any debate. **************************************************



	  **************************************************



	Amid fierce slogan shouting by the opposition, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said the Taxation Laws (2nd Amendment) Bill, 2016 was brought after it came to the government's notice that some people were trying to illegally exchange the demonetised Rs 1000 and Rs 500 currency notes. **************************************************



	  **************************************************



	He said as per the amendment proposed, those caught illegally converting money will have to cough up 60 peer cent tax plus penalties, which will come to 85 per cent. **************************************************



	  **************************************************



	Those who disclose black money to banks will have to pay 50 per cent tax, including surcharge and penalty. While they will get back 25 per cent immediately, the rest 25 per cent will be returned after 4 years. **************************************************



	  **************************************************



	"It will give means to the Government of India to run schemes like Garib Kalyan Kosh...I urge the House to accept the amendments," he said. **************************************************



	  **************************************************



	Speaker Sumitra Mahajan said since the bill is of urgent public importance, it has to be passed immediately. Though she wanted a debate, she said "it is impossible" because of the behaviour of the opposition members. **************************************************



	  **************************************************



	She also disallowed some amendments moved by opposition members as they required approval of the President which could not be obtained. **************************************************



	  **************************************************



	Two amendments by N K Premchandran (RSP) and B Mahtab (BJD) were allowed. While Premchandran refused to move the amendment as he was shouting slogans, Mahtab's was negated by a voice vote. **************************************************



	  **************************************************



	The Bill was later passed by a voice vote amid din. **************************************************



		Earlier, several opposition members said the bill could not be discussed before the debate on demonetisation as the measure was a follow up of the note ban decision. **************************************************



		  **************************************************



		Congress leader in the Lok Sabha Mallikarjun Kharge and TMC's Sudip Bandhopadhyay said the two -- Adjournment Motion on demonetisation and the Income Tax Amendment Bill can be discussed together as the issues were similar. **************************************************



		  **************************************************



		Saugat Roy (TMC) said since Jaitley yesterday introduced the Bill "surreptiously" and "stealthily" amid din, the opposition did not get a chance to oppose its introduction as per rules. **************************************************



		  **************************************************



		B Mahtab said discussion on demonetisation was also necessary along with a debate on the bill as it had serious repercussions on the Income Tax laws. He said a way should be found. **************************************************



		  **************************************************



		When opposition members questioned bringing the bill for consideration and passage today at a short notice, Jaitley and Information and Broadcasting Minister M Venkaiah Naidu said they were casting aspersions on the Chair. **************************************************



		  **************************************************



		Soon members rushed to the Well and kept shouting slogans till the bill was passed. Soon the House was adjourned for the day. **************************************************
