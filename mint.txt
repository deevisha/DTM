In a special broadcast on 8 November, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced a positive exogenous shock to the country. He declared that in less than four hours, Rs500 and Rs1,000 bills would be demonetized, thereby withdrawing their status as legal tender. India has one of the highest levels of currencies in circulation at over 12% of gross domestic product and of this cash, 87% is in the form of Rs500 and Rs1,000 notes. Globally, this is not unusual. Central banks of several countries pump massive amounts of cash into the economy, mostly in very large denominations. In the US, $100 bills account for 80% of the cash supply. In Japan, ¥10,000 note (about $100) accounts for 90% of total cash holdings. Across countries, most of this cash has been supporting underground black economies. For decades, economists such as Ken Rogoff and Richard Thaler have been arguing for a less-cash economy because it is safer and fairer.
				   
				The timing of this announcement seems obvious, in hindsight. With the massive rollout of the Pradhan Mantri Jan-Dhan Yojana (PMJDY) in India, citizens’ access to bank accounts is nearly complete. A demonetization move would have been impossible if low-income households were unbanked. PMJDY has provided them with free bank accounts, which will also be used to transfer government payments. The need for honest people to stash cash in mattresses, therefore, has diminished. This move by the PM has also followed the income disclosure scheme where people were given a window of opportunity to declare their wealth amassed through various means. It was an appropriate time, therefore, to make credible the threat of a crackdown on black money and corruption within India. The next few months will be painful, and should be seen as teething troubles for an economy trying hard to reform its corrupt self. There will be an urgent need for debit cards, electronic transfers and mobile payment platforms to be widely adopted. Behaviours change slowly, especially for those set in their ways. Institutional support from financial institutions, telecom platforms and payment interfaces will have to rise to the occasion and fill the supply gap. They will have to adapt to the ways of all, particularly those that are new to formal financial transactions. But there is more hope than ever before. My driver in Delhi gets his daily supply of Mother Dairy milk pouches using a Paytm card! If my friends at the Delhi Race Course used the same technology, they would be a happier lot today.As an economy we should aim to go less-cash, and not cash-less. Cash greatly facilitates transactions and that is why the government will introduce new Rs2,000 bills because there are legitimate high value transactions in every economy. The fundamental idea behind this exogenous shock is to raise the cost of illegal transactions. Cash facilitates crime because it is anonymous and big bills are easy to carry. So going less-cash is a fine balance between maintaining ease of financial transactions and curbing malpractices. Besides, the new Rs2,000 bills have been designed with enhanced security features, so this is not just new money replacing old money in the system.Will this eradicate black money and corruption in India? Some “experts” have warned that Indians are creative and will find ways to circumvent this demonetization. That’s true—there are ways to bribe officials, make criminal transactions and evade taxes without Rs500 and Rs1,000 bills. But removal of large bills will make several criminal and illegal activities more costly such as tax evasion, human trafficking, drugs, extortion and terrorism. Scaling back large bills will not end crime, but it will force the underground economy to employ riskier and less liquid payment methods. There is reason, therefore, to believe that this move will reduce corruption and several forms of criminal transactions in the economy.The  effect of this policy is not going to be uniform across the economy. Sectors that have a larger cash component in their transactions will be hit harder, such as real estate, movie production, campaign finance, etc. This will then be followed by a correction in these markets. Whether these corrections are deflationary (reducing prices) or contractionary (reduce business) is something to watch closely. However, these are corrections which will move the market equilibria to outcomes which reflect genuine demand and supply in the real economy. In the long run, this is a significant positive shock to the Indian economy and society. If substantially implemented, this will send a strong signal about India’s anti-corruption drive and is very likely to improve the country’s reformist stance. It also provides a boost to the government’s financial inclusion drive, pushing more households towards efficient banking and payment infrastructure. In the immediate run, we are likely to witness larger bank deposits, price corrections and better tax collection possibilities in the economy—all great for Indian bonds.This is not the first government to demonetize large currency bills. The European Central Bank has announced that it will phase out the €500 mega-note, much against the preferences of cash-loving Germans. The benefits of phasing out large paper currency are significant to an economy and even more to a society such as India where corruption has become an acceptable way of life. Modi has tightened the seatbelts and honest Indians are optimistic about the joyride ahead.

At the time of writing, the Indian markets have fallen a bit more than other emerging markets in Asia. The S&P BSE Sensex is down 3.8%, which is more than more or less all other Asian emerging markets. The possibility of a Donald Trump win is keeping markets on the edge worldwide. The extra fall in the Indian markets compared to others could be due to many factors, including high valuations, but it’s very likely that the demonetization effect is mainly responsible for the fall. 
				   
				That is clearly seen if we dig a little deeper. The Sensex is made up of very large companies which may not be impacted as much by the demonetization process. BSE’s mid-cap and small-cap indices have fallen by over 6% each at the time of writing. And in truth, the largest impact of the government’s move will be in the unorganised sector, which isn’t represented in the markets. Click here for enlargeThe true picture is reflected in sectoral indices such as the BSE Realty index, which is down as much as 15% at the time of writing. Some stocks such as DLF Ltd are down nearly 20%. This industry is known to entertain cash transactions of large magnitude. Similarly, stocks of jewellery companies such as Titan Industries Ltd have fallen by around 11% as well, perhaps because a lot of gold purchases are through cash. Besides, stocks of mid- and small-sized finance companies which collect payments in cash have fallen by 8-10%. Information technology stocks, for now, are down around 3%, which is more or less in line with the broad markets. While these companies will be unaffected by the demonetization process, this reflects a concern about a Trump presidency and a possibility of anti-outsourcing measures.

At the stroke of the midnight hour of 9 November 2016, India lost 86% of its monetary base. The media—print, electronic and social—has been fulsome in its praise of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s “master stroke” by which he has reportedly destroyed the base of corruption in India.  “Surgical strike”, “shock and awe”, “big bang reform” are only a few of the laudatory phrases used to describe the pre-emptive demonetization of Rs500 and Rs1,000 notes. There is no doubt whatsoever that Modi has pulled off a major political and publicity coup and substantially enhanced his reputation as a muscular leader, but surely somebody needs to ask: at what price?
				   
				Let me begin with the supposed gains from this measure. At the heart of all the rejoicing is the assumption that all those who have accumulated substantial amounts of ill-gotten wealth keep their takings in the form of cash, and use this cash to amass even more ill-gotten wealth through the black or parallel economy in an ever-growing spiral. If this is indeed true, then the demonetization will certainly have a huge positive impact on the state of the Indian economy by choking off the stock of liquidity which finances black activities. Unfortunately, this assumption is only partially, and not even substantially, true. While there are certain criminal activities (such as smuggling, drug peddling, gun running, etc.) that follow this pattern, they collectively account for a minuscule fraction of what is commonly understood as “black money”. The really big bucks come from two other activities—corruption and tax evasion.In both these cases, “black money” is a recurring income, and the recipients use the funds as all of us do our incomes—either consume it or invest it for future consumption. In either case, the cash does not stay with them for long and moves along an ever-widening ripple of transactions, most of which are perfectly legal. The illegality, if any, happens only to the extent that tax is evaded on the income from these secondary and tertiary transactions.  For example, if a jeweller accepts cash in payment for gold or an ornament, he is committing no illegality (indeed, by law, it would be illegal for him to refuse to accept legal tender). If he conceals this income, however, then, and only then, it remains “black” (this, by the way, is also true of real-estate transactions). Now let me come to the cost. Eventually, the bulk of the cash finds its way into the informal sector, where it provides a part of the essential liquidity for virtually all transactions within the informal sector and between the informal and formal sectors.  Considering the fact that the informal sector in India accounts for about 45% of gross domestic product (GDP) and nearly 80% of employment, disruption of this liquidity can be very costly indeed, both in terms of growth and equity. To make matters worse, some of this cash is held by hundreds of millions of the poor as savings and for meeting contingencies, and they have little else to fall back upon. To be sure, eventually most of these funds will be replaced; but during the interim, the human cost will be substantial. The magnitude of the cost obviously depends upon the speed at which the currency replacement happens, and also on the processes that are used for the replacement.  At the moment, neither holds much cheer, especially in rural and semi-rural areas. The officially projected best-case scenario is three weeks, which is a lifetime for the poor and indigent. And what of the unfortunates who have no proof of identity?There is, however, one component of the economy that may actually experience a permanent effect—the informal financial sector. This sector, comprising not only the much-reviled moneylender but numerous other institutions such as nidhis, hundis, chit funds, etc., will have a very hard time exchanging its stock of currency (some of which may well be black money), and may indeed suffer a permanent erosion in its lending capacity.  We might not shed any tears for them, but spare a thought for those whose livelihood depends on the capital provided by this sector because the formal financial sector will never touch them with a barge-pole. How large is this problem? I had made a rough estimation of this during the preparation of the 12th Five-Year Plan, and it came to nearly 40% of formal bank lending—i.e. 26% of GDP—which is not a joke.So what has this grand exercise actually achieved? First, it has certainly eliminated terrorist funding through counterfeit currency. Second, it has imposed a punitive cost on those who held their black assets as cash, and completely missed those who had converted their cash into real assets and foreign holdings. Third, it has put a dampener on certain kinds of criminal activity. Fourth, it has penalized virtually the entire informal sector, and perhaps damaged it permanently. Fifth, it has done absolutely nothing to curb either corruption or tax evasion. And all this at the cost of Rs12,000 crore in printing new notes and nobody knows how much in the logistics of exchanging the currency. Talk about cutting your nose to spite your face.Published with permission from Ideas for India (www.ideasforindia.in), an economics and policy portal.Pronab Sen is country director of the India Central Programme, International Growth Centre (IGC).Comments are welcome at theirview@livemint.com.Pronab SenTopics: demonetization black money Narendra Modi corruption Ideas for India

In the political battle that has emerged out of the demonetisation exercise, both proponents and opponents are ostensibly defending the interests of the poor. Some politicians are relying on anecdotal evidence to advocate the difficulties being faced by the common man. We instead use data from the National Sample Survey Organization’s (NSSO) survey to estimate such difficulties faced by the poor. The survey provides estimates of earnings in cash and kind by different income categories. We use the survey data for 2011 which comprised approximately 500,000 individuals across the country. Our estimates suggest that the poor are likely to have visited a bank branch at most once to exchange their earnings in the old currency notes to new currency notes. Thus, we infer that the politicians advocating the difficulties faced by the poor are being disingenuous in pushing their claims for political gains.
				   
				To estimate the above, we make the following arguments. First, the poor are unlikely to have substantial savings stored in Rs500 and Rs1,000 notes. Second, the bottom half of the population ends up spending almost their entire earnings on consumption. Third, only two weeks have passed since the demonetisation was launched on 9 November. Therefore, the weekly earnings of the bottom half of India’s income earners provide us the estimate of the cash that the poor would have in their kitty, which they would have to exchange in a nearby bank or post office. Finally, since the survey was conducted in 2011-12, we inflate the earnings by the average rate of inflation per annum during the period from financial years 2011-12 to 2016-17. This is likely to overstate the earnings of the bottom half of the population because, unlike salaried individuals and other richer sections of society, the earnings are unlikely to get adjusted for inflation in a consistent manner. However, the overestimation of earnings would only reinforce the bias against the inference that the poor are likely to have visited a bank branch at most once to exchange their earnings. As the adjoining table clearly demonstrates, the bottom half—be it rural workers, daily wagers, weekly wage earners, or fortnightly wage earners—earn less than Rs1,350 per week. In fact, even the bottom half among the urban population earns at most Rs1,970 per week. Even if the bottom half of the population has saved up to two weeks of their earnings, the amount they have to exchange will be less than the Rs4,000 limit that was set by the government in the first week. The above inference assumes that the daily, weekly or fortnightly wage earners were fully employed in the past several weeks so that they could not only earn enough for their consumption but also to save. In practice, such wage earners are chronically underemployed. As a result, the total cash in the hands of the bottom half is likely to be less than Rs4,000. Thus, it is quite clear from this data that the bottom half of the country’s population would have by now visited the local bank or the local post office at most once to exchange their old currency. Click here for enlargeThis conclusion then suggests that the long queues seen stem from two sections of the population: (i) people from the top half of the country’s income distribution, i.e. the richer folks, who want to exchange their honestly earned savings for new currency; and (ii) people who are acting as agents for the dishonest. The significant decrease in the queues after the government decided to use indelible ink to identify people that have exchanged their currency suggests large presence of the second category of people.Beyond doubt, the former category is inconvenienced and the government and the Reserve Bank of India  should take all steps  to ease their difficulties. But this category comprises people from the top half of the country’s income distribution, certainly not the poor. In contrast, those from the second category who stand in the queue are only making efforts to earn a premium from the dishonest, who are willing to pay them such premium to convert their black money into white. No politician who genuinely wants the country to clean up the black money menace should sympathize with the latter category. After all, they are abetting the dishonest in evading the legitimate tax and penalty.With respect to the difficulties that the country’s poor are likely to face till 30 December, note that around seven weeks of earnings are left before the deadline for depositing the demonetized notes. So, based on the estimates provided in the adjoining table, the maximum cash earnings of the bottom half would be around Rs8,000. Even if we suppose that they will be paid entirely using old currency till December, at most two more visits to the local bank or the local post office would suffice to deposit their old currency. Of course, it is quite likely that these workers refuse to accept their wage in old currency. In that case, they would not need to make the visit at all. As workers in this income category are likely to have been underemployed sometime in the past, they would have a bank account to receive Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act payments. Therefore, future wage payments can be made via cheque by honest employers. In this case, such workers may have to visit the bank once to encash the cheque.Note, we are not arguing that poor people are not facing difficulty because of demonetisation. Of course, standing in the queue for a day can mean loss of a day’s earnings for the poor. However, using the large sample data and careful analysis, we would like to highlight the exaggerated claims of disingenuous politicians who profess to be fighting for the poor.Krishnamurthy Subramanian and Prasanna Tantri are associated with the Indian School of Business.

The images on television are troubling. Harassed people queuing for hours. An elderly man, obviously quite sick, crying helplessly. The hospital wouldn’t admit him for the required surgery nor would the chemist sell him the drugs he needed because his money had ceased to be legal tender. A lady crying, her husband had just died because no hospital would admit him. The treatment money she had had suddenly become worthless. Frustration is widespread, patience is running thin, and there are worrying reports about incidents of violence, fortunately still isolated. It is a challenging moment for the country. It is a pity that instead of empathizing with the people in the queues, some TV panellists are dismissing their plight or even provocatively asserting that all complainants must be black-money wallas or terrorist sympathizers. Let’s step back from emotion and dispassionately consider the consequences of the demonetization shock.
				   
				In tune with Joseph Schumpeter’s theory of “creative destruction”, disruptive technologies and events are now considered to be good things, the forces that drive competitive capitalism. The demonetization shock is certainly disruptive. Eighty-six per cent of the money in circulation has been extinguished at a moment’s notice. It had to be done suddenly, without warning. Otherwise, its whole purpose would have been defeated. But is it good for Indian capitalism? What are likely to be its immediate and longer term consequences?In addressing these questions, we must first recognize that the big fish who have amassed huge wealth from black money, i.e., tax-evaded income, hold most of it as real estate, gold and other real assets. Some of it is also held as assets abroad. None of these will be affected by demonetization. A relatively small portion is held as non-bank money to finance “black” transactions. This component is the target of demonetization. However, black money cannot be easily separated from white money. It depends on whether or not a particular transaction generated any tax-evaded income. Some portion of such black money flows from criminal activities such as drug peddling, human trafficking or worse. But most of it is generated from normal economic transactions.ALSO READ | Demonetisation won’t be rolled back: Arun JaitleyThus, you may purchase something from your tax-reported income, i.e. from white money. But if the shopkeeper doesn’t report the transaction, the money now becomes black money. If he then spends it on something with tax-compliant billing, the money is transformed back into white money. Alternatively, he could under-report your transaction by, say, 50%. In which case half of the transaction is white money and the other half is black. Thus, the same Rs 1,000 note is white at some stage of its circulation and black at another, or a part of it is white and the other part black! It is therefore extremely difficult to estimate how much of the money in circulation is white or black or, for that matter, how much of India’s national income is white and how much is black. Without getting into technicalities, let it suffice to say that black money is so intermingled with white money and so widespread that any attempt to curb it sends shock waves through the system. The shock can have both negative and positive effects.ALSO READ | Demonetisation has achieved 50% of objective: Subramanian SwamyThe largest adversely affected group, numerically, is the working class. Casual workers are at the bottom of the working-class hierarchy. Their incomes are the lowest and least secure. They spend the money as they earn it. Those paid in old Rs500 or Rs1,000 notes would have had to lose a day’s wage to queue up at banks to convert their money. If the cash ran out, they would have had to lose another day’s wage. Meanwhile, they would have had no money to buy food, medicines or other essentials, and God help them if they had a medical emergency. In the towns and cities, these workers are queueing up at banks. What about unbanked villages? The banks have reportedly despatched armies of mobile-banking correspondents to service such villages. How that is working out on the ground I have no idea.Next, there are the medium-skilled blue- and white-collar workers in the unorganized sector and contract workers in the organized sector. Finally, there are the regular organized-sector workers, the most skilled and the best paid. All of these wage/salary recipients would have received their wages shortly before the demonetization. They too would have had to miss work and queue up at banks or ATMs to convert their money. Without conversion, they would have had no usable money for food, medical expenses and other essentials.ALSO READ | Demonetisation: Farm produce supply chains feel the pinchThe entire working class adds up to about 400 million persons. Most of them are unlikely to have any tax-evaded income because their annual incomes would be below the income-tax-exemption threshold. They and their families are bearing pain for the sins of others. Hopefully, the pain will be short-lived and the working class will be back to business as usual once the demonetized notes are replaced by new notes and normal money supply is restored. The next major group adversely affected are the small-medium enterprises in services and industry, especially wholesale and retail traders. Cash transactions are an integral part of their daily operations, especially for traders. Their range of goods includes everything from raw materials to intermediate inputs to food items and other consumer goods. Numerically, this class is not as large as the working class, but their impact on economic activity is very large. Demonetization is a bit like a car running out of fuel in their case. Their businesses have been severely disrupted. Those with substantial stocks of black money are also probably taking large haircuts. We are likely to see a significant dip in economic activity till January or even till the end of the financial year because of this disruption.The third group adversely affected are the self-employed professionals, for example, doctors, lawyers, accountants. It has been suggested that the incidence of tax-evaded income is high among this group, many of whom are high net-worth individuals. Their wealth portfolios would be similar in structure to those of the “big fish” even if not quite as large. For both groups, the large non-monetary component of their wealth would be unaffected, but the monetary component will be extinguished to the extent that demonetization forces the unloading of hoarded black money. For all the three groups above, the impact would probably be quite short-lived. But for a fourth category, the real-estate industry, the disruption is likely to be quite severe and long lasting. This sector is the destination where large proportions of black-money flows are converted into real assets, and black-money transactions are all-pervasive. The sector has already been in the doldrums for the past couple of years and transactions are likely to remain frozen for quite a while, with corresponding downstream effects in cement, steel and other construction materials.Turning to broader macroeconomic implications, let’s first look at the fiscal impact. Of the large deposits flowing into banks every day, if a significant component turns out to be tax-evaded income, it will generate an incremental flow of direct-tax revenue and penalties. On the other hand, as mentioned above, we are likely to see significantly reduced economic activity during the next few months, and that will reduce the flow of indirect-tax revenue. Clearly, no hard estimates of the net effect is possible at present. But my judgement is that total tax revenue will be well below budget projections, leading to an increase in the fiscal deficit.On the monetary side, a very interesting phenomenon is playing out. On the one hand, 86% of currency in circulation by value has been extinguished in one shot, delivering a huge negative monetary shock. On the other hand, there is a massive increase in bank deposits. Essentially, a part of the money supply that was taken out of the banking circuit has been brought back into it, i.e., from the black economy to the white economy. The large growth of bank deposits will enable the enhanced flow of bank credit. Whether that actually happens or not will depend on the banking sector’s other problems, particularly the dire stressed assets situation in public sector banks. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI)  has provided some accommodation on that front by recently easing its asset classification norms. Thus, there will be two forces acting to increase aggregate demand. The increased fiscal deficit and, possibly, the increased flow of bank credit. Whether this will be enough to offset the immediate negative impact of the monetary shock on economic activity is a judgement call. My own guess is that on balance, we will see a reduction in economic activity over the next few months. Will demonetization curb the growth of the black economy, its main goal? This question has to be addressed in the larger context of an evolving policy environment. The legislation on benami transactions is now in place. So is the bankruptcy code. Demonetization is forcing the declaration of hoarded black money. The goods and services tax will also tilt the scale against tax evasion. With the overall tightening of the regulatory environment, tax evaders and wilful defaulters may consider changing their game. Describing this as a possible paradigm shift in the policy environment, former RBI governor Y.V. Reddy mentioned in a recent conversation that action may gradually shift to the courts as tax evaders and wilful defaulters look for legal protection. Whether or not measures like demonetization can clean up Indian capitalism will depend ultimately on how effectively the judiciary, the legislature, the executive and RBI cooperate in the joint campaign against black money.Sudipto Mundle is emeritus professor at the National Institute of Public Finance and Policy, and was a member of the Fourteenth Finance Commission.Sudipto MundleTopics: demonetisation economic impact currency notes black money note ban

Reports of stress in agriculture have begun to appear because of demonetization. Cash is the primary mode of transaction in agriculture sector which contributes 15% to India’s total output. Formal financing in many parts, especially Punjab, Uttar Pradesh, Odisha, Maharashtra, Gujarat and Kerala is significantly from cooperative banks, which are barred from exchange-deposit of demonetized currency. Notably, this is a time of kharif harvest and start of rabi sowing, partly explaining why this period is dubbed the ‘busy season’ from a standpoint of credit demand, the other being bunching of festivals and weddings.
				   
				Agriculture is impacted through the input-output channels as well as price and output feedback effects. Sale, transport, marketing and distribution of ready produce to wholesale centres or mandis, is dominantly cash-dependent. Disruptions, breaks in the supply chains feedback to farmers as sales fall, increased wastage of perishables, lower revenues that show up as trade dues instead of cash in hand and when credited into bank accounts with limited access affect the sector.Currently, many of these networks are operating sub-optimally or altogether at a standstill, depending upon location, market links and other item-specific factors. The input side is equally affected as many payments/purchases, such as seeds, fertilizers, implements and tools, are outright in cash. Borrowing-financing operations of larger farmers and organized producers are also cut off or severely clipped. ALSO READ:   Two weeks of cashless in the countryThe impact is visible in different sub-segments. Winter crops such as wheat, mustard, chickpeas are due for sowing in a fortnight. Wheat prices were already up due to low stocks and anticipated shortfall in 2015-16 output and have firmed up further as demonetization fallout pushes traders to build more inventories. Production in 2016-17 could drop if sowed acreage (rabi) reduces for want of enough seeds on time to exploit the adequate soil moisture. Yields could fall from late sowing and subsequent exposure to rough spring weather, the lack of sufficient or timely application of fertilizers, pesticides, etc. Farm labour, vital for this period, is reported to be unpaid as farmers have no cash. Many of them are reported to be returning from some northern parts to homes in UP and Bihar. Labour shortages and wage-spikes may follow with a lag. Plantation crops such as rubber, tea, jute, cardamom are seeing no wages paid to workers. Small-medium tea growers have few buyers now (a third of the tea was unsold in recent auction in the south). Raw jute trade is halted as paucity of funds affects procurement-delivery by traders. Projections of scarcity have appeared with appeals for official procurement support. Cotton is witnessing havoc: daily arrivals have plunged to 30,000-40,000 bales against the usual 1.5-2 lakh bales at this time (harvest) as per reports and prices have soared 9% in a week, pushing up global prices in turn. ALSO READ: Arun Jaitley says govt to announce more steps to ease cash crunch in rural areasVegetables and fruits that along with crops added 61% of agriculture’s gross value added in 2015-16, depends critically upon a cash-strapped transport sector for daily supply network. Sales have dropped sharply (25-50%) across markets with occurrences of dumping. At present, demand is repressed for want of currency, so prices are subdued, but eventually, supply shortages could cause prices to rise. How long can the demonetization drag upon agriculture persist? And how soon could the segment rebound? The answer is up in the air at this point. Production patterns and cycles vary and there is little guidance as to when the demonetization dust finally settles. However, gestation periods extend from 2-3 months for vegetables and 4-6 months for oilseeds, pulses and cereals. Production losses in vegetables cannot be recouped and is a permanent loss. Lower cereals, oilseeds outputs would persist until the next harvest, or about nine months and it is certain that incomes and profit margins will be hurt. Price and output effects will reflect all the above listed factors. This means considerable fluctuations, increased uncertainty and risk.

New Delhi: The government’s move to suck out 86% value of money in circulation by demonetizing Rs.500 and Rs.1,000 currency notes will adversely impact India’s economic growth, at least in the short run, fear some economists. Some others, however, maintain that the demonetization move, taken to weed out black money and counterfeit notes in circulation, will have little effect on the economy.
				   
				Former chief statistician of India Pronab Sen said with 86% of value of money in circulation, the economy will have to make do with only 14% of money in circulation at least for two weeks, until when there are restrictions on withdrawing money. The government has announced that withdrawal through ATMs will be limited to Rs.2,000 per day up to 18 November and Rs.4,000 per day thereafter. Cash withdrawal from one’s bank account is also limited to Rs.10,000 per day and Rs.20,000 per week till 24 November.Also read: Scrapping Rs500, Rs1,000 currency notes was in the works in secret for 6 monthsSen said this will impact a large number of cash transactions which will have a multiplier effect on the economy. “If I am not going to able to sell, I am not going to buy from my supplier which will kickstart a chain reaction. So even if the first round impact of lower money circulation may not have a large impact, the chain effect will be large,” he added.Sen said it is the informal sector accounting for around 40% of the economy which will be impacted the most, especially in rural India. “This is likely to reduce GDP growth by one percentage point this year (2016-17),” Sen warned.GDP growth in the first quarter (April-June) slowed down to 7.1% from 7.5% during the same quarter a year ago and the slowdown is attributed to increase in subsidy payments by 53% which resulted in lower growth in indirect taxes. The government expects the GDP to grow at 8% in 2016-17 on the back of a bumper farm production due to normal monsoon.Sen said the situation could have been better handled by giving a longer period of time to phase out high-value currency notes instead of making them invalid overnight. “The impact in rural India will be much more due to the sheer logistical difficulty for banks to reach out to depositors. It will also impact urban poor who depend on daily wages,” he added.N.R. Bhanumurthy, professor at the National Institute of Public Finance and Policy, said a decline in money supply will directly impact growth in the short run using the quantity theory of money.“If all the money sucked out of the economy does not come back which is likely due to the existence of black money, then it will directly impact growth in the short run. The extent of its impact on growth will depend on the size of unaccounted money in the economy,” he added.Also read: Demonetization to give major push to e-wallets, payments through UPICurrent chief statistician of India T.C.A. Ananth, however, said the disruption due to demonetization in the economy is unlikely to be significant. “The rural economy has changed a lot compared to what it is used to be 30-40 years ago. It is only a transitory phenomenon of shifting from one currency to the other and is unlikely to have any significant impact on the economy,” he added.Finance minister Arun Jaitley, responding to a question at a press conference on Wednesday, ruled out any short-term impact of demonetization on growth, holding that it will rather benefit growth in the long run because “all this will impact the size of the GDP itself because more transaction that were happening outside the (formal) economy will get into the economy itself”.However, both Sen and Bhanumurthy said demonetization will bring down inflation in the economy, though for different reasons.Sen said lower money supply will lead to a deflationary situation with too little money chasing too many goods. Bhanumurthy, on the other hand, said demonetization will play a positive role in curbing inflation in the medium term due to lower money supply as unaccounted money used in sectors like real estate and higher education will be taken out of the system.Asit Ranjan MishraTopics: Demonetization GDP Rs500 notes Rs1000 notes Indian economy

Vijay Shekhar Sharma was ecstatic on the night of 8 November. The Union government’s decision to ban Rs500 and Rs1,000 currency notes, and replace them with new high-denomination notes, was a game-changer for digital mobile payment platforms, such as Sharma’s Paytm. 
				   
				“Keep the money digital. Superb step by our dear PM @narendramodi. From a bit inconvenience to incredible bold step! #win# The biggest, boldest and the most ambitious surgical strike by any government in the world. Hats off to our PM for removing Rs500/1,000 notes. This is a golden day to be a tech entrepreneur in India. Specially a FinTech one,” he tweeted. A week after the announcement, Sharma says Paytm continues to see a huge jump in usage, particularly from merchants signing up to use the app to collect payments from customers. “From 3,000-4,000 sign-ups a day (before the announcement), we are now signing up 25,000 merchants a day, with the highest number of merchants in tier-II towns, not so many in tier-I towns,” he claims over the phone, adding, “We hope to have four million merchants signed up by March 2018.” The company has also revised its estimate of customer “wallets” to 500 million customers by 2018, which it earlier thought it could achieve by 2020. “Daily transactions have jumped 250%, compared to a week before. We are well ahead of five million transactions a day, which is more than the point-of-sale card sales issued by all banks and cards combined,” Sharma claims. Paytm’s competitors have also claimed increase in their customers.For Sharma “this is the influx point for those business consumers and merchants, who were earlier sitting on the fence. Paytm and mobile payments are now an obligation, and not just a choice, but the best choice. There are sectors we did not touch earlier, such as some everyday needs, who have started accepting us as a viable method. Earlier we were fancy, convenient, a new-age method. Now we are mainstream, we are necessary.”Paytm also released full-page print advertisements, published in the country’s leading newspapers, congratulating the Prime Minister on this move. Commentators questioned both the timing and the propriety of featuring the Prime Minister’s photograph. “They were just an impromptu acknowledgement that this is a golden age for financial inclusion against black money,” Sharma reiterates.Leadership speak■ On the new payments bank We will not be a banker for half a billion Indians, we will be a wealth manager of half a billion Indians. I don’t think we, as a savings account, will fight for a interest rate, we will fight for better returns for your money which can come from the wealth management. ■ On competitionIf competition can keep you awake, then you are in the wrong business and your plans are down. Competition should not define who you are. In fact, we internally have an obligation not to talk about competition. I tell my people: Please remove the competition slides, I am not interested, you are wasting time.   ■ When someone disappoints himI think I’ll say that I expect you to be smarter. Definitely expect you to be much better than this. And I am not saying that because you will be, I am saying it because I feel you better be. If you don’t be, then there will not be a place for us tomorrow.Aparna Piramal RajeTopics: Paytm Vijay Shekhar Sharma One97 Communications Mobile digital payments Demonetisation

Vadodara: Two leading bank unions on Monday criticized the government over demonetization of Rs500 and Rs1,000 notes, saying the move has led to “financial chaos” across the country. 
				   
				In a letter to Indian Banks’ Association (IBA), All India Bank Officers’ Association (AIBOA) and All India Bank Employees Association (AIBEA) said the decision to withdraw the high-value notes was taken without proper planning or preparation. They also highlighted heavy work pressure on employees and officers at bank branches in the wake of demonetization which has led to customers rushing to exchange the now defunct notes. “Chaotic situation is prevailing at the bank branches and this is unbearable for both customers as well as bank employees and officers,” S Nagarajan, general secretary of AIBOA, and C H Venkatachalam, his counterpart at AIBEA, said in the letter to IBA, the apex body of bank managements. There is a huge shortage of Rs100 notes which are now in great demand for routine needs, while most customers are not willing to accept the new Rs2,000 bill, they said. “The centre and the Reserve Bank must be fully aware that already there is a huge gap between the indent and supply of Rs100 notes. For example, in 2015-16, as against the indent of 535 crore pieces of Rs100 notes, the supply received was only to the tune of 490 crore pieces,” according to the letter. “One cannot understand the reason behind banning the existing Rs500 notes and not providing new supply of Rs500 notes in time,” it added. Most of the 2.20 lakh ATMs across the country are closed or partly functional. This has put additional pressure on the staff and customers are compelled to visit branches to withdraw cash from their accounts, the two unions said. Nagarajan and Venkatachalam requested the IBA to ensure the RBI supplies adequate cash in denominations of Rs100 and new Rs500 notes to ease pressure on banks and provide relief to customers.

Mumbai: The central government’s move to withdraw Rs500 and Rs1,000 currency notes in circulation on Tuesday at such short notice may have come as a surprise, but it’s not the first time the government has demonetized banknotes.
				   
				Withdrawal of high-denomination rupee notes is a radical measure the government normally resorts to in an attempt to counter forgery. It has been done at least twice in India’s history in the past time. This time, the attempt is to crack down on black money.In January 1946, Rs1,000 and Rs10,000 banknotes were withdrawn. In 1954, Rs1,000, Rs5,000 and Rs10,000 notes were reintroduced and were again demonetized in January 1978.The second demonetization has a backstory. In the early 1970s, the Wanchoo committee on black money had recommended withdrawing certain banknotes. However, this suggestion could not be acted upon because the very publicity given to the recommendation resulted in black money operators getting rid of high-value currency notes.In 1978, the Janata Party coalition government, which had come to power a year earlier, decided to withdraw Rs1,000, Rs5,000 and Rs10,000 notes by issuing an ordinance on the morning of 16 January that year.The Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) history (third volume) describes the process in detail. It goes something like this:On the morning of 14 January 1978, R. Janaki Raman, a senior official from chief accountant’s office in RBI, was asked by a government official over telephone to go to Delhi to discuss matters relating to exchange control. On reaching the capital, Raman was told that the government had decided to withdraw high-denomination notes and asked to draft the necessary ordinance within a day. During that period, no communication was allowed with RBI’s central office in Mumbai, “since such contacts could give rise to speculation.” The draft ordinance was completed on schedule and sent for signature to President N. Sanjiva Reddy in the early hours of 16 January. The news was announced on the All India Radio news bulletin at 9 am on the same day. The ordinance provided that all banks and treasuries would be closed on 17 January.The then RBI governor I.G. Patel was not in favour of this exercise. According to him, some people in the Janata coalition government saw demonetization as a measure specifically targeted against the allegedly “corrupt predecessor government or government leaders”. Patel recalled in his book Glimpses of Indian Economic Policy: an Insider’s View, that when finance minister H.M. Patel informed him about the decision to withdraw high-denomination notes, he had pointed out that such exercises seldom produces striking results. Most people, Patel said, who accept illegal gratification or are otherwise recipients of black money, rarely keep their ill-gotten earnings in the form of currency for long. The idea that black money or wealth is held in the form of notes tucked away in suitcases or pillow cases is naive, Patel said. In any case even those who are caught napping or waiting will have a chance to convert notes through paid agents as some provision has to be made to convert at par notes tendered in small amounts for which explanation cannot be reasonably sought, he added.Gopika GopakumarVishwanath NairTopics: Rs1000 notes Rs500 Notes Rupee Cash Demonetization

New Delhi: A week after the Narendra Modi government’s decision to implement India’s biggest demonetization drive to eliminate black money, fake currency and corruption, the detractors of the Prime Minister are trying to rally the opposition and people against the government. A major demand that has come from several political quarters is that the government should rollback the move and extend the deadline to let people use the old currency notes. 
				   
				The government found some support from the Supreme Court, which refused to stay the government’s notification demonetizing Rs500, Rs1,000 currency notes. But the apex court asked the government to file a report on the steps taken to reduce public inconvenience.A meeting of the opposition parties, including Congress, the Left parties, Trinamool Congress (TMC), Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and Janata Dal (United) (JDU), on Tuesday to evolve a common strategy to corner the government in the winter session (which begins on Wednesday) of Parliament failed. The leaders will meet again on Wednesday.Here is what has been said so far:Arvind Kejriwal: “In the name of black money, PM Narendra Modi has served poison to the people of this country calling it a ‘kadak’ chai. It is for the first time in history of independent India, a sitting PM’s name has come in black money transactions,” reports The Economic Times. The Delhi chief minister made the comments while moving a resolution in the assembly urging President to direct Centre to withdraw demonetisation scheme. Kejriwal also demanded a Supreme Court monitored probe into the entire exercise. Earlier in an interview to Network18, the Delhi chief minister had said: “People who have black money are also of two kinds. One, who are the friends of Modiji, of the BJP; and ones who are not the friends of Modi ji, or the BJP. Modiji’s people, those belonging to the BJP had information of this move a week to two months earlier – they got the signal that such a move will come, you take care of your money, aap apne paise thikane lagalo’.”Akhilesh Yadav: “I am very clear on this...black money should not be generated. Economic experts say the magnitude of the global economic crisis at times is not felt in India because of strong (parallel) economy of black money.”Mamata Banerjee: “There are thousands of areas where there are no proper banking or post office facilities. What will the people there do? The people of this country have been turned into beggars due to demonetisation move,” as Mint reports.She also added: “Black mechanism’ with indelible ink shows this government distrusts the common people.”P. Chidambaram tweeted: “Millions of working people standing in queue. Long live Productivity. Thousands of ‘rich’ and ‘corrupt’ persons standing in queue. The poor are cheering from their homes! Banks are doling out cash to citizens. That is proof that ‘Achhe Din’ have arrived!”S. Sudhakar Reddy, general secretary, the Communist Party of India (CPI), demanded the Centre should allow use of old notes till 31 December: “If the Prime Minister is sincere, he should apologise to the nation and set right things by allowing people to use the old currency till 31 December for all public utilities like journeys, hospitals, medical shops, tax payments, phone payments, to purchase foodgrains, and essential commodities.”Kapil Sibal: “Modi ji said, Rs80 trillion is outside India & he would bring it back in 100 days. Where is the Black Money? As far as Black Money is concerned, Modi ji has yet to give the names to the Supreme Court. PM is unable to understand the hardships of the common man.”Amarinder Singh, former Pubjab chief minister: “People are dying, with your ‘kadak chai’ (strong tea) giving them ulcers on empty stomachs. Those standing in long queues at ATMs and banks to exchange/withdraw a few thousand rupees of their hard-earned money, those dying in hospitals due to refusal to accept old currency, and those going to bed on an empty stomach-are the actual sufferers of this move. The vision of your ‘kadak chai’ haunting them in their nightmares are not the rich and mighty, but the poorest of the poor of this country,” reports PTI.LivemintTopics: Narendra Modi Demonetization Currency Note Ban Mamata Banerjee Arvind Kejriwal

The unanticipated shock of demonetization, making 86% of cash with the public illegal, is a massive disruption for the Indian economy. Following this, many reports and analyses have focused on its growth impact. A fairly common conclusion is the move will cause “short-term pain” but growth gains in the long term: In the short-run, consumption spending is particularly likely to be hit as also vast tracts of the cash-based productive segments. As the dust settles, and agents realign to higher levels of formal or recorded transactions, growth benefits will follow through a wider tax-base, better tax compliance, reduced transaction costs and enhanced efficiencies in various supply-chains; macroeconomic indicators are likely to improve too as inflation slows, fiscal balances improve and interest rates soften further on the ground. 
				   
				The short-term effects are straightforward and real. Remember on the eve of this quarter, all but the private consumption driver of aggregate demand were non-existent. Private investment was showing no pickup, public capex was constrained, exports remained weak; private consumption too was dragged down by two successive drought years. In this configuration, growth expectations for the remaining half of 2016-17 depended on spending support from increased salaries of central government employees and robust rainfall effects on rural incomes. The transitory but severe cash and credit crunch directly hurts consumption or 55% of demand, which is majorly transacted in cash; production segments where working capital and trade payments are cash-based; and incomes by destroying wealth (undisclosed as well as preferential cash holding of savings, etc.) and many daily-wage and short-term contract employees. Growth is expected to fall for two quarters from such effects, but this period is subject to how long the currency deficit endures; the latter could be quite long for remonetization is constrained by logistical rigidities in printing and distribution that are ill-equipped to match the scale and magnitude of withdrawal of currency with the public. Can we be confident about a medium-term growth rebound thereafter? The state of the economy matters significantly here because that will primarily determine response capacities of each segment, sub-segment and interactions within to influence aggregate outcome. There is anxiety on this count. A look into the past few years reminds us that the slowdown in investments and exports is protracted, not new; use of manufacturing capacities has steadily been falling; non-performing and stressed asset levels are still on the rise, magnifying the balance sheet stress of large corporates and the banking system; deleveraging is progressing slowly, yet incomplete, while resolution of bad loans is proving difficult. GDP growth in the last two-three years has come off various stimuli – some from public capital spending support, but majorly from one-time, terms of trade gains that are now wearing off. In this setting, demonetization could impose enduring costs via increased uncertainty, a possible risk-aversion as changes in spending behaviour of businesses and consumers become harder to predict; temporary strains upon already weak balance sheets could stretch out with further negative impact. Adjustment costs attached to any reform or shock responses are outweighed by expected future benefits when firms and banks are healthy, incomes growing, and demand prospects positive and certain. If we add global headwinds of political change and policy uncertainties to the domestic economic settings, it is hard to be sure that GDP growth will return robustly once normalcy is restored, i.e. it will not be hurt beyond the short-term.

The Narendra Modi government’s decision to withdraw Rs500 and Rs1,000 currency notes as part of a crackdown on black money couldn’t have come at a worse time for the Kerala government, which is already short of cash and struggling to fund expenditure.
				   
				The public finances of Kerala are tight. The state has piled up debt of Rs1.3 trillion, with the remittance pipeline shrinking because of the oil crisis in the Gulf countries.The impact of demonetization will be more severe in Kerala than in many other states, according to state finance minister Thomas Isaac. The estimated loss to the public exchequer has already exceeded Rs2,000 crore and it will take at least four months to emerge from the present crisis, he added over the phone. Many major sources of revenue—commercial taxes, liquor and lotteries—have taken a hit. The cooperative banking sector, which has an estimated deposit base of more than Rs50,000 crore and is considered to be the fulcrum of financial life for many Keralites, has come to a standstill. The cooperative banks were put in a tough position after the central bank decided to not allow them to exchange the scrapped Rs500 and Rs1,000 notes over the counter. The result is that they can neither accept invalidated notes nor exchange the new currency to continue daily operations.On the revenue front, high levels of tax collection sustain Kerala’s coffers. The lion’s share of this revenue mobilization came from commercial taxes, which range from Rs2,800 crore to Rs3,000 crore a month on average, government estimates show.But since demonetization started a week ago, financial transactions have declined so much in the state that commercial tax collection is likely to decrease by at least 20% for this month, V.J. Gopakumar, deputy commissioner (general) at the Office of the Commissioner of Commercial Taxes, said over the phone. That translates to a loss of Rs600 crore.Land transactions have gone south too, said Gopakumar, and the government is expecting a drop of 50% in the stamp duty collection, which would translate to a loss of another Rs250 crore.The loss for Kerala State Finance Enterprises (KSFE), a highly profitable government company which runs chit funds, would be roughly Rs600 crore, says Isaac.Sales of two other major streams of revenue for Kerala—alcohol and lotteries—have nosedived, official estimates show. The per day collection of roughly Rs30 crore at the beverage outlets has dropped by nearly 30%, leading to a loss of about Rs50 crore since 9 November, said H. Venkatesh, managing director of Kerala States Beverages Corporation, which runs 270 of the 306 retail liquor outlets.The Kerala government cancelled eight daily lotteries and postponed the draw of 10 others after the demonetization, and sales turnover plummeted from around Rs25 crore to Rs1-7 crore, The New Indian Express reported on Tuesday. The sale of lotteries contributes more than Rs5,000 crore per year to the state treasury and sustains the families of a large number of physically challenged persons who are its sellers. The combined loss out of cancellation and sales drop would come to around Rs281 crore, said the report.However, in a media briefing on Thursday, chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan said government salaries would not be affected.“A clear picture will emerge after the 25th, when we start calculating the bills coming to the treasury for this month,” said a top official in the state government, declining to be named. “Buses are plying empty, the fish markets are closing down, transactions are not happening... all of this going to reflect in the bills.”Nidheesh M.K.Topics: Demonetization kerala black money Pinarayi Vijayan Thomas Isaac

Indian banks, especially the state-owned ones, could see better third-quarter results as a consequence of demonetization, according to Aashish Agarwal, the country head of research at Asia-based equity broker CLSA Ltd.
				   
				A sharp increase in low-cost current and savings account deposits, as well as improved treasury profits due to falling interest rates, could lead to better results for banks in the second half of 2016-17, Agarwal said in an interview.“Demonetization will have two or three big benefits for the banking system as a whole. Banks will get a lot of CASA (current and savings account) deposits coming at a huge spread to them. They will be paying an interest of 2-3% on deposits and will be deploying them at 6-7%. This gives them a spread of 3-4% on a huge sum of deposits over a long period of time,” Agarwal said. “It will also improve liquidity, which will bring down interest rates. When interest rates come down, banks will make treasury gains on the total investment book.”The benefits will mainly accrue to state-run banks as they have been at the forefront of opening Jan Dhan bank accounts that could see huge inflows, Agarwal said, adding that since public sector banks are less profitable at present than private banks, the incremental gains to state-owned lenders will also be higher as a percentage of profits.Around 20-25% of state-owned banks’ profits in the third-quarter could be on account of monetization,  said Agarwal.The fact that most state-owned banks declared losses in the third quarter last year, consequent to the asset quality review initiated by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), would add to the base effect.“State-owned banks are likely to report profits in the second half of the year as the pace of NPL (non-performing loans) addition falls and because of demonetization,” Agarwal said.This could ease the pressure on state-run banks, some of whom have reported consecutive quarterly losses as they had to set aside more funds for bad loans to meet RBI’s provisioning requirements.However, banks could also see some pain due to demonetization after the first 6-8 months. This is because the negative impact of demonetization on consumption and sectors such as real estate could get reflected in banks’ balance sheets.“The liquidity crunch will affect SMEs (small and medium enterprises) more. And again the impact is likely to be more on state-run banks. So you will see a fresh cycle of NPAs (non-performing assets) in 6-8 months but it will be a smaller exposure,” Agarwal said.Remya NairTopics: Banks s500 scrapped Rs1000 scrapped Demonetization Aashish Agarwal

Mumbai: A significant number of transactions used to evade taxes by trading in penny stocks were cash deals. 
				   
				The withdrawal of higher denomination notes is likely to  deal a blow to such tax evaders, especially because the capital markets regulator has banned only a fraction of entities involved in such scams, said an income-tax official on condition of anonymity.An investigation by the tax department last year uncovered a trail of Rs38,000 crore involving manipulation in 84 BSE-listed penny stocks and through 5,000 listed and unlisted firms, many of them shell companies. The taxman’s report said at least 64,811 entities evaded taxes through such fraudulent methods. So far, the Securities and Exchange Board of India has barred only about 1,500 entities. Last Friday, a member of Parliament wrote to the finance minister questioning the regulator’s selective orders. Mint has reviewed a copy of the letter.ALSO READ | Penny stocks may come under long-term capital gains tax net“The cash economy is a crucial element of this tax evasion scam. With the current stock of large denomination notes being banned, at least these scammers will not be able to use their hoard of cash and prevent future loss of revenue,” said the tax officer cited earlier.  In this type of tax evasion, penny stock companies would allot preferential stocks to non-promoters who are seeking to evade taxes. Their associates would drive up the price of the stocks, whose ownership is concentrated in a few hands, through circular trading (buyers and sellers are connected). After a year, the preferential allottee cashes out at a much higher price. Any capital gains from shares held for more than a year are fully exempt from taxes. Typically, the entity buying the stock would be funded by the preferential allottee, thus allowing this entity to bring its black money into the system.The promoter of penny stocks, the share brokers and other operators purchasing the shares transacted in cash, said the income-tax department report. In some cases, investors made gains of as much as 25 times their original investment, the report added.“The purchase consideration is again provided in cash by the investor, which is laundered to the buyer’s account through a maze of shell companies,” said the report.In the case of  16 companies, the tax department has been able to trace the full cash trail worth Rs1,575 crore, the report said.“This shows how unaccounted/undisclosed cash of beneficiaries is being routed through this modus to convert black money into LTCG (long-term capital gains tax),” the report said.After the tax department forwarded its report to the capital markets regulator, the Securities and Exchange Board of India, through interim orders in 2014 and 2015, had suspended over 200 firms and barred close to 1,500 entities.But these pertained to trading in only seven penny stock firms compared with the 84 companies investigated by the taxmen.On 14 November, Mint reported that the government was considering a plan to remove penny stocks from the long-term capital gains tax exemption. The applicability of LTCG depends on whether securities transaction tax (STT) was paid at the time of the sale of shares. LTCG will be tax-exempt only if the investor had paid STT at the time of sale of shares on a recognized stock exchange. STT is a tax payable on the value of securities transacted through a recognized stock exchange. As of 2016, it is 0.1% for delivery-based equity trading.Jayshree P.

Beijing: Terming Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s decision to demonetize high value currency notes as “startling and bold”, Chinese official media has said it is “far from enough” and India may “look at ideas” from China’s crackdown against corruption which has shown “efficiency”. 
				   
				Modi in “a startling and sudden move” demonetized Rs500 and Rs1,000 currency notes to “demonstrate that he is truly up for a fiercer fight against black money and corruption”, an op-ed article in the state-run Global Times said. “Modi means well and his decision was made based on the reality in India, since most illegal business in the underground economy is cash-only, and Rs500 and Rs1,000 notes constitute over 80% of all cash circulation in India. Nevertheless, we can hardly count on the new rule to fully root out corruption,” stated the article titled ‘Beijing offers clues for Modi’s new anti-corruption moves’. Since Modi assumed office, he has carried out a number of measures to crack down on black money, corruption and tax evasion. However, many of them are believed to be “without teeth and can’t begin to scratch the surface of the problems he faces”, it said. India’s new policy to scrap high value notes is considered a “risky, but a bold and decisive step”, it said. “And yet, delivering a corruption-free country requires more than banning currency notes. The key should be reforming systems. In this regard, New Delhi might need to look for ideas from Beijing,” it said, referring to the massive anti- graft campaign carried out by President Xi Jinping in which over a million officials at different levels were punished. Since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party in 2012, during which Xi was elected as its general secretary, and taking over as the president and military chief launched the anti-graft campaign which also attracted criticism that he used it effectively to consolidate his power emerging as the most powerful Chinese leader after party founder Mao Zedong. “Over the years, China promoted anti-corruption laws, improved the supervision system, deepened judicial system reforms and adopted measures to make sure the system is transparent,” it said without referring to criticism about the campaign. “For instance, China’s foreign ministry has lately published information about the families of 12 senior officials on its website in an effort to fight against corruption through familial networks by improving transparency. These steps are taken to ensure that achievements made in the struggle against corruption can be consolidated by laws and systems,” it said. China is still on its way toward building a comprehensive anti-corruption system. But “compared with India, Beijing’s method has already shown its efficiency”, it said. “More time is needed to see whether Modi’s new policy will turn into a huge blow against corruption in India. The hard truth is that the corrupt and fraudulent won’t just conduct shady deals by using cash, but with gold, real estate and overseas assets. Corruption can be bred in a variety of ways. Blocking the circulation of large currency bills is without question far from enough,” it said. PTIPTITopics: Demonetization Narendra Modi Chinese media Xi Jinping black money

Bengaluru: Ride hailing company Ola Wednesday introduced Ola Credit, under which customers can ride now and pay within seven days. The option, however, has been made available only to select customers based on their ride history, and has to be chosen at the time of booking.
				   
				ANI Technologies Pvt. Ltd which runs Ola, however, declined to share exactly how many users will benefit from Ola Credit.The service will be available across all categories available through Ola, including auto, outstation and rental car segments. Ola Credit was prompted by the withdrawal of Rs500 and Rs1,000 notes which has created a cash shortage, the company said. “This is not a product on which we are making money. This is a facility that has been extended to Indian citizens at a time when they need to conserve cash,” said Raghuvesh Sarup, chief marketing officer and category head, Ola. There will be no limit on the number of rides a customer can take each week using Ola Credit. The amount due each week can be paid through net banking, debit or credit cards, or through Ola’s own wallet, Ola Money. “Financial stipulations indicate that if there is a default on the loan, we either extend the credit period or send reminders to the customers,” said Sarup. Ola’s corporate customers will also benefit from Ola Credit.Ola drivers will not be impacted based on how a customer chooses to pay, and will continue to receive their daily settlements as usual, Sarup said. Like other e-wallets, a day after the government announced demonetization, Ola Money too saw a surge in transactions and recharges, the firm said. Apart from booking cabs on Ola, Ola Money can be used for recharges, sending money to others with the wallet and at about 500 offline and online merchants including merchants like Pizza Hut, BookMyShow, IRCTC, Domino’s and Cleartrip. Ola has so far raised about $1.2 billion from Tiger Global Management, Matrix Partners, SoftBank Group, Didi Chuxing and several other investors.It is locked in a battle for market share with Uber in India, which at a $68 billion valuation, is the world’s most valuable start-up.Sadhana ChathurvedulaTopics: Ola ANI Technologies taxi uber demonetisation

Washington: The IMF on Friday said it supports the Narendra Modi government’s efforts to fight corruption through demonetization, but noted that the transition needs to be managed “prudently” to minimise any disruption. 
				   
				“We support the measures to fight corruption and illicit financial flows in India. Of course, given the large role of cash in every day transaction in India’s economy the currency transition would have to be managed prudently to minimise possible disruption,” International Monetary Fund (IMF) spokesman Gerry Rice told reporters at a news conference in response to a question. He was asked to comment on the Indian government’s decision to withdraw Rs500 and Rs1,000 currency notes from circulation. “I am just saying that when countries make these kinds of move, which is not exceptional—countries do this quite often—the transition needs to be managed very well,” Rice said in response to another question.

She also spoke to CPM general secretary Sitaram Yechury on the matter.

Breathing space for people,” West Bengal chief minister  Banerjee tweeted. “Today I spoke with several political leaders regarding a joint movement and to meet Rashtrapati Ji together. Let us all fight this together to give relief to common citizens, the poor and stop this financial anarchy,” she added.The CPM is the principal opposition party in West Bengal. In 2011,  Banerjee's TMC came to power in the state, trouncing the CPM-led coalition that had ruled the state for over three decades.“Mamata Banerjee called Sitaram Yechury. She told him they should join hands and meet the president over demonetization move by the Modi-led central government. Yechury told her he was travelling and will reach out after consulting with his colleagues in Bengal,” said a CPM leader, who did not want to be named.Separately, Kejriwal continued his attack on the central government. “There is still time; take back this decision before the law and order situation further deteriorates. The government must come with a solution to deal with the law and order situation. People cannot wait for 50 days for things to come under control when they have no food right now,” Kejriwal said.Pretika KhannaTopics: Mamata Banerjee Sitaram Yechury CPM Trinamool Congress demonetization

New Delhi: Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) president Amit Shah on Friday asserted that rival parties have exposed themselves and shown their true face by criticising the Centre’s demonetization move which, he said, has rattled those with black money and fake currency and made some political parties poor as well. 
				   
				Taking a swipe at his rivals, the BJP chief said he would like to ask Congress, Samajwadi Party (SP), Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) and  Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) as to why they are so pained. Shah said while he understands dealers of black money, fake currency, hawala and drug are rattled what he cannot fathom as to why leaders like Mulayam Singh Yadav, Mayawati and Arvind Kejriwal are joining the list of such people.Also Read: Will Narendra Modi’s big currency-scrapping gamble yield results? Even though he insisted that the government’s move had nothing to do with the impending assembly polls, he said BJP will benefit politically going by the reactions of opposition parties. Assembly polls on his mind, Shah consistently targeted SP, BSP and Congress, BJP’s rivals in Uttar Pradesh, AAP, its challenger in Punjab besides Congress, but skipped any mention of  Trinamool Congress (TMC) chief and West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee, who was the first leader to take on the government. He named her in his reply to a question. “I can understand the pain of those keeping black money, fake currency, terrorists, hawala operators, naxalites and drug dealers with this decision. What has amazed me is the way some political parties are rattled. “I want to ask Mulayam Singh Yadav (SP president), Mayawati (BSP chief) Rahul Gandhi (Congress vice president), and Arvind Kejriwal (AAP chief) as to why you are so rattled? If politics become cleaner with a measure and black money is taken out of electoral politics, then why should it pain political parties,” he said. Also Read: IMF says Modi govt’s demonetization move needs to be handled prudentlyHe challenged political parties to face the polls with the issue and said “People will decide.” These political parties always questioned the Modi government what it was doing against black money and now it has given such a hard blow to black money and they are rattled, he said. “The kind of environment these political parties are making I want to ask them if you are in support of black money, hawala operators, terrorism, fake currency dealers... SP, BSP, Arvind Kejriwal and Congress should answer this. “What is the problem of these four parties? They have exposed themselves and shown their true faces,” Shah said. To a poser that these parties have claimed to have voiced concerns of the poor, he said the demonetization move will do no harm to the poor. “But some political parties have become poor.” Asked about Mayawati’s charge the move amounted to “economic emergency”, he said it has caused economic emergency in her party BSP.PTITopics: Amit Shah Demonetization Narendra Modi political parties Black money

New Delhi: Just a day after Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced scrapping Rs500 and Rs1,000 bank notes, the move was challenged in the courts on Wednesday. 
				   
				Sangam Lal Pandey, an Uttar Pradesh-based lawyer, moved the Supreme Court on Wednesday evening, seeking quashing of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) notification scrapping the high-value notes.“Emergency services are vastly affected due to the notification,” said the petition, a copy of which Mint has seen. Also Read: Rs500, Rs1000 notes scrapped as legal tender: Narendra ModiSeparately, two lawyers of the Bombay high court pleaded before the court to take up the case on its own motion. According to Hindustan Times, lawyers Jawahar Mistry and Jabbar Singh cited a 2 November notification of the RBI, asking banks to dispense more Rs100 notes through ATMs within the next fortnight. RBI’s statement said it issued this notice after it observed that very few banks had taken steps to dispense lower denomination notes after a 5 May circular asked for the same thing.The bench led by Justice M.S. Karnik directed that the case be listed before a regular bench of the court when it reopens after vacation next week. Apurva VishwanathTopics: Rs500 Rs1 000 currency notes PIL

Shares of non-banking financial companies or NBFCs have lost their sheen, at least temporarily, as demonetisation has cast a shadow over their business.
				   
				While the structural growth story of the sector is likely to remain intact in the long term, the ones that are overly dependent on cash transactions may find it difficult to transition to a digital or less-cash economy, experts say.“If demonetisation actually encourages digital transactions, banks can improve their underwriting skills with this poorly banked community—this could impair the long-term (economic) moat for some of these NBFCs who have thrived in this cash economy,” said Nirav Sheth, head of equities at SBICap Securities Ltd.On 8 November, the government scrapped Rs500 and Rs1,000 banknotes in a surprise move intended to eliminate black money and counterfeit currency notes.Before demonetisation, NBFCs had scripted a success story. In an April report, PricewaterhouseCoopers and Assocham said their contribution to the economy has jumped to more than 14% in March 2015 from 8.4% in 2006.In terms of financial assets, NBFCs have recorded a healthy growth—a compound annual growth rate of 19% over the past few years—comprising 13% of the total credit, the report had said.The demonetisation drive has at least temporarily disrupted the business model of these companies. “For NBFCs, this dislocation can also increase NPLs (non-performing loans) in the near term, though unlikely to be a major stress area. The big question though is how long will it take to come back to pre-monetization growth levels? If you don’t have these answers, valuations are pricey,” Sheth said.NBFCs were among the most favoured stocks among investors before the demonetisation move. According to data from Bloomberg, of the 19 NBFCs in the BSE 200 index, six had registered gains of more than 50% since the start of the year until 8 November. All 19 stocks had posted positive returns from the start of the year until 8 November.Post-demonetisation till date, around seven of the 19 firms have seen more than 15% of their value eroded.Pre-demonetisation, the top-performing NBFCs in the index were Cholamandalam Investment & Finance Co. Ltd, which had gained 73% until 8 November. It has fallen 14.64% since then. Bharat Financial Inclusion Ltd followed next with a 65% rise until 8 November. This stock has fallen 15.34% since 8 November.From the start of the year up to 8 November, BSE’s benchmark Sensex rose 5.64%, but it has since fallen 4.93%.“Post-demonetisation, those NBFCs which have cash collections and cash disbursals—such as MFIs (microfinance institutions) or rural financiers—have been hit the most, and are the most vulnerable,” said Ajay Bodke, chief executive officer and chief portfolio manager (portfolio management services) at Prabhudas Lilladher Pvt. Ltd.Bodke pointed that one of the segments that had shown very strong traction and grown significantly for NBFCs was loan against property or LAP.“Most of the LAP loans are given to businessmen. Because of demonetisation, business cash flows come under strain, risk goes up for lenders. LAP business becomes vulnerable,” he said.The demonetisation move led to economists cutting GDP estimates for Asia’s third-largest economy, and analysts also looked to revise the earnings estimates downwards.Interestingly, earnings recovery was expected to be round the corner, before the government scrapped the high-denomination notes, on the back of a good monsoon after two years of drought.Currently, these NBFCs in BSE200 trade between 0.71 times to 7.18 times price to book value (P/B). In comparison, private banks in the BSE 200 list trade between 0.58 times to 4.38 times P/B.“Even at current corrected prices, NBFCs seem to be too expensive. Private banks are a better bet in the financials pack at this point,” Bodke said.Parag Jariwala, vice-president of institutional research at Religare Capital Markets Ltd, does not think there is a question mark on the structural story. “Though we agree that stock will impact flow to certain extent, we don’t agree to the thesis that large part of small/SME (small and medium enterprises) borrowers will move to banks. Many SME units may still do some business in cash,” Jariwala said in a note on 17 November.Ami ShahTopics: demonetization NBFCs cash digital payments loans

New Delhi: The income tax department on Wednesday surveyed some real estate players in the national capital region to check reports of alleged profiteering and tax evasion by these entities while converting the recently demonetized currency notes. 
				   
				Officials said the department conducted the exercise on at least four such entities in the Delhi-NCR region and visited over half-a-dozen premises. They said the tax sleuths made an inventory of cash and sale documents at these locations and checked sale documents. Officials added the department also scanned some records of some previous sales made and have asked the officials of these firms to produce the records at a later stage. When contacted, real estate firm Amprapali Group called the I-T operation a routine exercise. “A team of tax officials have visited our office premises and they are inspecting the company books and accounts. It is a routine exercise done by them,” Amrapali executive director Shivpriya told PTI. Asked whether the survey was linked to the illegal usage of demonetized Rs500 and Rs1,000, Shivpriya said: “We sell affordable homes which are largely funded by customer home loans. I-T officials have not found any cash.” Another group and real estate brokerage firm called it a “normal” operation. “They (tax officials) came to check if we are accepting cash or not. We are doing legal business. We deal in primary market where there is no cash,” Investors Clinic Infratech Private Limited founder and CEO Honey Katiyal said. Under the survey action, the tax sleuths visit business premises of the trader/operator and make analysis of the available stock and record it, whereas under search operations both residential and business premises are visited by the taxman. The department, since last week, had detected unexplained cash and sales worth Rs100 crore in a similar crackdown by traders, jewellers and other operators while converting demonetized currency notes.PTITopics: Demonetization real estate income tax rs500 rs1000

New Delhi: A day after the government scrapped Rs500 and Rs1,000 bank notes, the government said on Wednesday that high-value transactions will come under the tax department’s scanner and that there will be no immunity for cash deposits made.
				   
				All cash deposits of more than Rs2.5 lakh made till 30 December in a bank account will be reported to the tax department by banks. It will then be matched with the depositor’s income tax returns and suitable action taken, revenue secretary Hasmukh Adhia said, adding that smaller deposits made by housewives, small businesses and artisans that fall below the taxable income threshold will not come under the department’s scrutiny.In case of large cash deposits of more than Rs10 lakh that are not explained by the income declared in the income tax returns, it will be treated as tax evasion and the tax amount plus a penalty of 200% of the tax payable would be levied.ALSO READ: Scrapping Rs500, Rs1,000 currency notes was in the works in secret for 6 monthsReacting to reports that people are buying jewellery using unaccounted funds, Adhia said the tax department had issued instructions to field officers to ensure jewellers are verifying the permanent account number (PAN) of the buyers.“When the cash deposits of the jewellers would be scrutinized against the sales made, whether they have taken the PAN number of the buyer or not will also be checked,” he said in a written statement. Adhia tweeted that farmers should not be worried about making cash deposits in banks as their genuine income is not taxable.However, the farmers’ income should not be disproportionately high compared to the yield expected from the land owned by him, he wrote.Keen to minimize inconvenience caused to households, the government, along with the Reserve Bank of India, has charted out a plan to ensure that there is no fund crunch.Automated teller machines will be frequently refilled and banks will be open on Saturday and Sunday. A format has been prepared for collection of information about depositors and CCTV cameras will be used to keep track of them. Banks have also appointed nodal officers to deal with situations as and when they arise. People should be able to withdraw Rs500 and Rs2,000 notes from all ATMs latest by Friday, said finance secretary Ashok Lavasa.The government has also expanded the list of uses of the phased out high-value notes in the next couple of days. People can use Rs500 and Rs1,000 notes for recharging metro rail tickets, toll plaza payments, pay for medicines purchased from government and private medical shops, cooking gas cylinders and for tickets to enter monuments run by the Archaeological Survey of Industries, the finance ministry said. ALSO READ: How badly has demonetization of rupee hit the Indian markets?On Tuesday, after announcing that Rs500 and Rs1,000 notes will cease to be legal tender from Wednesday, the government had permitted the use of these notes till 11 November in railway stations, government hospitals, government-run cooperative shops, air ticket counters, milk booths, petrol stations, burial grounds, international airports and for foreign tourists. The government estimated that high denomination notes constitute around 86% of the total notes in circulation.In a press briefing on Wednesday, finance minister Arun Jaitley said the steps taken by the government “do not merely nudge the economy in the direction of cashless economy but gives a significant push in that direction.”Jaitley said that it was clear that a parallel black money economy was present in India, leading to tax evasion and tax non-compliance. “The Prime Minister made up his mind sometime back that Rs500 and Rs1,000 notes should be considered as illegal tender,” Jaitley said, adding that the move will help boost the economy and increase direct and indirect tax collections in the long run.Countering claims made by former finance minister P. Chidambaram that the cost of replacement of the currency could be as high as Rs15,000-20,000 crore, Jaitley said, “These numbers are highly exaggerated.” He added the final cost will be known only once the printing process is completed.The government estimates it will take around three weeks for the currencies to be adequately replaced.

The impact of the government’s move to eliminate current high-value currency notes on FMCG (fast moving consumer goods) companies can be seen in two parts. One is on the distribution channel as small retailers—who make up the bulk of sales—mostly deal in cash. While consumers will recover relatively quickly as the new currency notes become available, trade channels may take a few weeks as their transactions will be of higher value. If their purchases decline, that will affect sales growth reported by companies.
				   
				The second impact is at the consumer level if the move causes a liquidity crunch. Consumer staples may not see a sizeable impact, though some down-trading to lower value packs may be seen. Discretionary consumption may see some impact as consumers with a liquidity crunch may become choosy on where they spend.The current quarter may, therefore, show some impact of this development on sales growth of companies. This comes even as some pockets of revival in growth are becoming visible. If the rural economy revives as expected, then the headwinds from the government’s move will be easier to manage. Even otherwise, it does not appear as if FMCG companies will face any lasting impact because of this decision. Even then, the BSE FMCG index was down by 2.1% on Wednesday.

New Delhi: There was little respite for cash-starved people queuing up outside banks and ATMs on Sunday, with branches witnessing unprecedented rush since early morning. 
				   
				Due to bank closure on Monday in some parts of the country, distressed people are thronging branches since most of the ATMs are out of cash. Much to people’s dismay, only 60% of ATMs got valid currency feed five days after Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the surprise demonetization of two high-value currency notes. Even these 1.2 lakh ATMs (out of total 2 lakh) are running out of cash in few hours, leaving people frustrated. Accepting that the common man is being inconvenienced, finance minister Arun Jaitley on Saturday said it may still take up to three weeks for ATMs to start functioning normally. “ATMs could not have been calibrated (before the demonetization announcement) because of secrecy issue. Thousands of people are involved in recalibration exercise (and) secrecy could not have been maintained. Recalibration takes at least 2-3 weeks,” Jaitley had said. According to a senior official at a Canara Bank branch in central Delhi, Sunday is a testing time for bankers. To meet the heavy rush, more counters have been opened and middle management, including assistant general managers and deputy general managers, are dispensing cash at many branches. Reports of chaos and scuffles at bank branches and ATMs streamed in from different parts of the country on Saturday. There were also reports of heated exchanges between hassled customers and overworked bank officials.PTITopics: ATM banks queue black money Rs500

Most microfinance institutions (MFIs) have liquidity in the form of unencumbered cash and unavailed bank lines of credit for just 30-60 days to meet debt obligations in case of business disruption, India Ratings and Research said. 
				   
				In a report on Thursday, the rating agency said that the capital levels of some MFIs may near the minimum regulatory level by March if the repayment cycle does not return to pre-demonetization levels.All MFIs are required to maintain a capital adequacy ratio of 15%, according to the central bank’s norms. Capital adequacy is a measure of financial strength expressed as a ratio of capital to risk-weighted assets.  “The agency expects MFI borrowers to reprioritize their expenses on account of a cash flow mismatch in the next few weeks. This would lead to an increase in one-month overdues of many MFIs,” the report noted. The cash-dominated microfinance industry, which extends small loans to unbanked and self-employed low-income earners, has come to a halt after the government’s move on 8 Nov­ember to scrap Rs500 and Rs1,000 notes. Most micro lenders have deferred repayment by a week for the convenience of borrowers. “We have cash for 60-90 days to meet our debt obligation. We have seen behaviour changes in our borrowers as a few of them have started paying us by cheques from Monday onwards,” said K. Paul Thomas, chairman and managing director of Esaf Microfinance. The Microfinance Institutions Network (MFIN) and Sa-dhan, two self-regulatory bodies of MFIs, have sought clarification from the central bank on whether to accept scrapped currency notes.The India Ratings report said that, in the short term, microfinance borrowers will switch to regular banking and in the long term will park their savings with MFIs that turn into small finance banks. “More cash-out points need to be in place, which will hopefully come up with payment banks. Account usage and savings behaviour is likely to significantly improve after the demonetization move,” said Sucharita Mukherjee, chief executive of IFMR Holdings. According to data available with MFIN for the first quarter, the eight microfinance companies that will become small finance banks by March account for 40.50%, or 1.45 crore, of the 3.58 crore customers of MFIs. Among the eight, Equitas’s small finance bank has started operations and Suryoday Microfinance Pvt. Ltd and Ujjivan Financial Services Ltd have received final approvals.

New Delhi: Government’s move to demonetize currency will impact the secondary steel sector as most of the business conducted by these mini mills and rolling factories is cash-based, which in turn would help the large producers, Tata Steel Ltd said. 
				   
				Counted among the top 10 steel makers globally, the Mumbai-based firm said that demonetizing will also temporarily impact steel demand in rural India as the business there is also mostly cash-based. “We are watching secondary sector very closely because a lot of that business used to happen on cash. And maybe 60-70% of the long products business is actually driven by the secondary sector. “So it could have a significant positive impact on the long products business for the integrated or bigger players,” Tata Steel India and South-east Asia managing director T.V. Narendran said in an investor call last week. Government demonetized Rs1,000 and Rs500 notes from the midnight of 8 October with the aim to fight black money and corruption. “But in any case, market was shifting towards integrated sector because between JSW Steel Ltd, Tata Steel Ltd, Rashtriya Ispat Nigam Ltd (RINL) and Jindal Steel and Power Ltd (JSPL) and everyone else, lot more long products capacity is being added over the last few years, which is encouraging the consumer segments to shift towards formal sector. But, demonetization move should accelerate that process,” Narendran said. The secondary steel sector, which accounts for almost half the steel produced in India, uses sponge iron and scrap to make steel in small induction furnaces. These producers generally procure sponge iron feedstock from nearby manufacturers and sell crude steel, mostly pencil billets and ingots, to re-rollers. India, the world third largest steel maker, produced 89.58 million tonnes of the metal in 2015. Tata Steel is also witnessing some impact on logistics as some movement of material got disrupted due to “confusion at the toll gates and excise points” which is getting “sorted out”, Narendran said.“Rural demand, which is largely cash-based, will get impacted temporarily. Our dealings with our distributors are largely on real-time gross settlement systems (RTGS), and the dealings of our distributors with their dealers is largely on RTGS. Its only the final consumers who tend to pay cash,” Narendran said. He further said, “So there could be some sort of hiccups there for sometime. But, I don’t think, we see it as a big issue over a long period of time. We are interested to see what’s happening in the real estate markets and the impact it will have there. But, otherwise, the rural markets, we think, will pick up very quickly.”PTITopics: Tata Steel impact on rural demand demonetization black money T.V. Narendran

Mumbai: A week after the government withdrew high-denomination notes, it is struggling to meet replacement demand with smaller-denomination currency bills.
				   
				While the new Rs2,000 note has started circulating in the banking system, far fewer new Rs500 currency pieces are ready.The Security Printing and Minting Corp. of India Ltd (SPMCIL), the government agency that produces notes and coins, has printed only 15 million pieces of the new Rs500 note, said two people aware of the matter.ALSO READ | Modi’s new strike against black money backfiresThe order for the new Rs500 note was 400 million pieces by November, but the presses at Dewas (Madhya Pradesh) and Nashik (Maharashtra) are running below capacity, leading to a delay in the release of this note.According to the plan drawn up by the government and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), the central bank-operated presses were to produce the Rs2,000 note and government-owned printers the new Rs500 note.Bharatiya Reserve Bank Note Mudran Pvt. Ltd (BRBNMPL), a subsidiary of RBI, with two presses in Mysuru (Karnataka) and Salboni (West Bengal), has printed nearly 1.5 billion pieces of Rs2,000 notes so far. These presses together had an order to print 3.5 billion pieces, said the two people, requesting anonymity.ALSO READ | Rs10,861 crore: The printing cost to maintain currency flowThese RBI-owned presses will soon start printing the new Rs500 notes to bridge the gap in supply, said one of the two.An email sent to SPMCIL did not elicit any response. An RBI spokesperson declined to comment.Government officials said there was no delay in printing and transporting Rs500 notes.Click here for enlarge“We planned to first bring the 2,000 rupee notes as the focus was to create high-value notes to ensure the smooth replacement of the old 500 and 1,000 rupee notes. We would have to print four 500 rupee notes for every one 2,000 rupee note. If we would have focused on printing the 500 rupee notes, the entire printing exercise would have taken much longer,” said an official who didn’t want to be named.As an Indian Express report on Sunday pointed out, SPMCIL may have been caught unawares as its officials had been expecting a New Year launch of the new notes. All the printing presses started production in September after they received the signature of the new RBI governor, Urjit Patel, said the people cited above.A look at the capacity of these presses shows why replacing the banned bank notes isn’t easy. According to the two people, the SPMCIL presses have a combined capacity of printing eight billion pieces a year; BRBNMPL can produce 16 billion notes.That makes up a total of 24 billion pieces a year, or roughly 2 billion pieces a month (of all denominations). In comparison, the number of Rs1,000 notes and Rs500 notes that have to be replaced is 22 billion (March 2016 data). In the last three fiscals, the average volume of notes supplied by the presses was 22 billion annually.There are a couple of  caveats.One, this 24 billion capacity is on a two-shift basis, while the presses are right now operating three, effectively increasing capacity by 50%.Second,  it is not a piece-to-piece replacement. The 3.5 billion pieces of Rs2,000 bank notes amount to Rs7 trillion. That more than compensates for the withdrawal of the Rs1,000 bank notes amounting to Rs6.3 trillion. The number of Rs500 notes that are being withdrawn and have to be replaced was 15.7 billion at the end of March.To be sure, RBI may have placed orders for notes of other denominations. But the heavy lifting in meeting replacement demand will have to be done by the new Rs500 notes, of which there is a shortage.Remya Nair contributed to this story Gopika GopakumarTopics: Demonetisation New Notes New Notes Printing Costs Rs500 notes Rs2000 notes

New Delhi: Cashing in on the opportunity of demonetization of Rs.500 and Rs.1,000 notes, mobile commerce firm Paytm has launched a full-fledged marketing campaign to promote its cashless payment option. Paytm is run by One97 Communications Ltd.
				   
				One of the early movers in the cashless payment space, Paytm, founded by Vijay Shekhar Sharma, sprang into action immediately after the demonetization on 8 November, releasing  full-page print ads congratulating the Prime Minister, with a word play on its tagline ‘Ab ATM nahin, #Paytm karo.’Paytm simultaneously simplified the method of using the app for the new users.With Rs.600 crore allocated for branding and marketing in 2016-17, Paytm is leaving no stone unturned to milk the opportunity. The marketing plan designed by the company along with its agency on record, McCann Delhi, was implemented when the firm on 12 November rolled out television commercials ‘Drama band karo, Paytm karo’ (Stop being melodramatic, use Paytm) which featured a visibly angry woman talking about the hardships that demonetization has created especially for daily wage workers or household helps who are often paid in cash.The campaign miffed a section of social media users after which the firm tweaked it changing the tagline to ‘Chinta nai, Paytm karo’ (Do not worry, use Paytm). Currently, the upgraded ad campaign is being run across television channels with ads featuring different content. “The Paytm ads creatively depict how our cashless payment solution can come as a great relief as millions of Indians run out of cash. The video essentially highlights Paytm’s strong product benefits and drives the message of financial inclusion,” said Shankar Nath, senior vice president, Paytm.Admen and branding gurus feel that while Paytm has created trust among consumers in a rather risky sector like payments, the firm must exercise caution when it comes to the tonality of its current campaigns. “The brand will be enthusiastic because a huge opportunity has fallen in its lap. I think it’s all about finding the appropriate restraint to be able to deal with it without coming across as over-eager. Paytm is a strong brand because it provides a real utility,” said Santosh Desai, chief executive officer (CEO) of Future Brands.Desai’s observation is in line with the unprecedented growth numbers of Paytm. Currently, the platform claims to have 150 million wallet users with five million transactions a day and is on the way to processing over Rs.24,000 crore of transactions by the end of this fiscal year.“The company registered a 700% increase in overall traffic and 1000% growth in the amount of money added to the Paytm account over the last couple of days. During this period, the transaction value continued to be 200% of the average ticket size while the number of app downloads went up 300%. The number of transactions per user also went up from three transactions to over 18 transactions in a week,” said Paytm’s Nath.With over 850,000 offline merchants using Paytm across India, Paytm’s communication is also looking to target daily wage workers such as electricians or plumbers with a do-it-yourself (DIY) print ad. This is a target group which wasn’t the focus for the company up until now.Paytm’s marketing journey started in 2014 when it came out with its first television campaign. Its first major ‘Paytm Karo’ campaign was launched in April 2015 after the platform became the associate sponsor for the Indian Premier League, the popular Twenty20 cricket tournament.  Subsequently in July 2015, Paytm won the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI)’s title sponsorship rights for four years for over Rs.200 crore.Since then, the company has been investing heavily across print, broadcast and digital media to reach out to its consumer base. With over 80% of its users between 18-34 year olds, the top ten markets for the firm include Bengaluru, New Delhi, Hyderabad, Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai, Pune, Ahmedabad and Jaipur, among others.“India is an overly cash dependent country which needs to change. I would strongly suggest any move that a brand makes to help consumer move from cash to card. I’m surprised that none of the credit card companies have leveraged this golden opportunity (demonetization),” said Ambi M.G. Parameswaran, brand strategist and founder of Brand-Building.com.Saumya TewariTopics: Paytm Demonetization advertising Vijay Shekhar Sharma marketing

Chennai: Disputing government’s claim that demonetisation of higher value currency notes would check black money, former Union finance minister P. Chidambaram on Saturday said it would only adversely affect the common man.
				   
				The senior Congress leader said the people were facing difficulties in buying medicines, buying bus and train tickets and paying for auto-rickshaws because most of the notes in circulation were of Rs500 and Rs1,000 denominations. “They (government) say that the withdrawal of notes that are highly in circulation will not affect the common man. That is quite a funny statement,” he said. “It is not a step to curb black money... The Centre’s move will only affect the public and that is my view,” he told reporters here.Chidambaram said that  the Central Board of Direct Taxes, in 2012, had advised the Centre to avoid issuing Rs2,000 currency notes, saying it would bring more harm to the public than benefit. “Ignoring it, the Centre has withdrawn Rs500 and Rs1,000 notes that are highly in circulation,” he added. The former Union minister further said that 86% of the total value of currency notes in circulation was in the denomination of Rs500 or Rs1,000. Chidambaram said there were currency notes worth about Rs17 lakh crore in circulation across the country, and according to the RBI, about Rs400 crore of this was believed to be fake currency. “Just to destroy Rs400-crore fake currencies, why the circulation of total Rs17 lakh crore was needed to be blocked,” he asked. On criticism by the BJP that Congress vice president Rahul Gandhi’s standing in a queue to exchange notes was a mere photo opportunity; he reasoned, “What can he do? How can a person live with a currency that is invalid? That is why he went to exchange Rs4,000 (to the bank). I do not know whether the valid notes were exchanged in the houses of the respective ministers. For rest of the people, one has to visit the bank for exchange of notes.” PTITopics: Rs500 notes Rs 1000 notes P Chidambaram Fake Currency Congress Leader

Bengaluru: Karnataka chief minister Siddaramaiah on Thursday wrote a letter to Union finance minister Arun Jaitley, drawing his attention to the non-applicability of the demonetization scheme to district cooperative banks (DCCB) and the hardships it was causing to farmers and milk cooperative societies. 
				   
				He urged the central government to modify its notification and restore DCCBs’ eligibility to accept deposits as under the scheme on par with commercial banks. This is the second letter from Siddaramaiah to Jaitley this week on the impact of demonetization of Rs500 and Rs1,000 currency notes. “Several lakh farmers depend on DCCBs for their banking needs. Debarring DCCBs from the demonetization scheme amounts to un-banking millions of farmers in one stroke without providing an alternative,” he said in his letter on Thursday. ALSO READ: Ban on Rs500, Rs1000 notes: Siddaramaiah writes to Arun JaitleySiddaramaiah, who also holds the state’s finance portfolio, said that DCCBs are licenced banks and must be treated on par with commercial banks. Karnataka has 21 DCCBs with 706 branches spread mostly in rural areas. In his letter, Siddaramaiah said that prohibiting DCCBs from exchanging old currency notes for new has resulted in farmers being unable to remit cash into their bank accounts as repayment of crop loans within due dates, rendering them ineligible under the state government’s interest subsidy scheme.

Kolkata: West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Monday lashed out at Prime Minister Narendra Modi for his statement that poor are enjoying a sound sleep after demonetization, saying it is an “insult” to the common people. 
				   
				“The PM in his speech said that the poor are sleeping peacefully. This is an insult to commoners and in bad taste,” the Trinamool Congress (TMC) supremo said in a tweet after Modi’s statement in Ghazipur. “My humble suggestion is not to hit the common people like this,” she said. Banerjee said while the masses have been victimised and crushed under the weight of demonetization, many economists are now predicting the onset of recession. “This will be a killer for the common people. Already a staggering Rs1.5 lakh crore of gross domestic product (GDP) has been lost by the economy in only six days,” she said in a statement. Speaking at BJP’s ‘Parivartan Yatra’ in Ghazipur on Monday, Modi said, “After demonetization, the poor are enjoying a sound sleep while the rich are running from pillar to post to buy sleeping pills.” Banerjee, who is in the forefront of the opposition’s attack against the Modi government on demonetization issue, had said she was not averse to working with arch-rival Communist Party of India (Marxist)  and other opposition parties like Congress, Samajwadi Party, Bahujan Samaj Party to fight against the “anti-people” government which has imposed an “undeclared emergency”. She also spoke to President Pranab Mukherjee on Sunday over the centre’s demonetization move and said representatives of political parties will meet him on this issue.

New Delhi: The Trinamool Congress (TMC) on Wednesday threatened to disrupt proceedings in both houses of Parliament if its demand for an adjournment motion over the demonetization of bank notes is spurned.
				   
				TMC chief and West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee and her party colleagues, along with leaders of the Aam Aadmi Party, Shiv Sena and National Conference led a march to Rashtrapati Bhavan to express their concerns around Rs500 and Rs1,000 currency notes ceasing to be legal tender. “We had a successful meeting with the president during which we discussed the issue. And the President said he would look into the matter,” Banerjee said, adding that TMC would move an adjournment motion in the Lok Sabha if the demand was not accepted.An adjournment motion is meant to force a parliamentary debate on a matter of urgent public importance with the consent of the presiding officer of the House.“The unfortunate part is these disruptions are going to affect legislative business. Opposition parties, including BJP when it was not in power, use the same tactics of obstruction and hamper the working of Parliament,” said S.K. Dwivedi, a political analyst and professor of political science at Lucknow University. The coming together of TMC and Shiv Sena is interesting because the latter is a partner in the ruling National Democratic Alliance (NDA) and the Bharatiya Janata Party-led coalition government in Maharashtra.  The threat of an adjournment motion and march on Rashtrapati Bhavan came as Prime Minister Narendra Modi held out a reassurance that the government was ready for a discussion on all issues. Modi said the enabling legislation for the goods and services tax (GST) was passed in the last session in a “very big achievement.”“I had thanked all parties for this,” Modi told reporters on the first day of the winter session. “We are ready to hold discussions on all issues in the winter session and we look forward to a positive discussion. We will debate every issue with an open mind as this leads to good decisions.” A heated debate in the Rajya Sabha on the first day is expected to spill over to the Lok Sabha. The Congress party, which is the largest political group in the Upper House, said the prime minister had implemented the demonetization, which has been followed by a run on bank branches and ATMs, without compassion for the poor.  The Lok Sabha adjourned for the day after mourning former members who had passed away. In the Rajya Sabha, Congress’ attack was led by the party’s deputy leader in the Upper House, Anand Sharma, who said “friends of the BJP” knew about the demonetization in advance.“Your government is insensitive...I condemn the prime minister for calling the poor standing in queue for his Rs4,000-4,500 (in exchange for old notes), black money holders and scamsters,” Sharma said, adding that the decision was “ill-timed”, “ill-conceived” and had unleashed “economic anarchy”.Opposition parties said the prime minister should have been present in the House during the discussion. A demand for a Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) to look into demonetization is expected to be raised in Parliament on Thursday.Union power minister Piyush Goyal led the government’s defence, slamming Sharma for alleging that news of the decision had been leaked in advance. “There is no politics in it. It is a step taken in national interest. If anyone has the strength to take on black money and corruption, it is the BJP government and Narendra Modi,” Goyal told the House. The government said it had started a war against corruption. “The opposition parties have to decide at the end of the day which side you are on. The government has been trying to locate black money since it came to power,” information and broadcasting minister M. Venkaiah Naidu said.Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) chief Mayawati accused the government of being unprepared for the aftermath of demonetization. “I am not against the decision of the government. But it was taken without preparation which has led to problems for the common man. The situation in the last few days is reminiscent of economic emergency and Bharat bandh,” she said.AnujaGyan VarmaTopics: Demonetization Rs500 notes Rs 1000 notes note ban winter session

Upaj, which means growth or produce, is a term of great significance in Hindustani classical music. A more nuanced explanation of the term points towards the practice of impromptu elaboration and expansion through which musicians take seed ideas and elaborate on them, growing them as it were, to their full potential through spontaneous displays of virtuosity and talent. This spontaneity in elaboration is greatly valued by both musicians and music lovers. But musicians do not restrict their penchant for upaj to music-making alone, and are known to utilize their skills with generous doses of good humour in a variety of situations and conditions. Here’s how the recent demonetization of Rs500 and Rs1,000 currency notes also prompted some enjoyable upaj laced with good humour. 
				   
				The popular TV show Kon Hoeel Marathi Crorepati 2016 (KHMC 3) includes a special weekly segment titled Ghar Baslya Kamwa (GBK; Sit at home and earn) in which a quiz question is posed to the public. Participants are asked to select the answer from four options that are provided to them. Within a stipulated time and date, participants have to submit their answers either by SMS in a specified format, or through an IVRS (interactive voice response system). The participant who provides the correct answer first receives Rs50,000 as prize money. In a recent episode of KHMC 3, the question posed to the public concerned Hindustani classical music. Participants were asked which instrument iconic musician Pandit Hariprasad Chaurasia is associated with. Options included A. Jaltarang, B. Shehnai, C. Tabla and D. Bansuri. To the shock and horror of music lovers and musicians, Option B, namely shehnai, or sanai as it called in Marathi, was declared the correct answer. Vishal Khokade of Bhilwadi, the participant who provided the supposedly correct answer, was declared the lucky winner without anyone discovering the mistake up until the time of the telecast. The well-known fact of Pandit Hariprasad Chaurasia’s name being inextricably linked with the bansuri or flute did not, in this case, deter the shehnai from trumping the bansuri. Students of music on a WhatsApp group, of which I too am a member, discussed the mistake. Just when everyone was indignant at how such a colossal mistake could have remained unnoticed, Abhimanyu Herlekar, a young tabla player who is also administrator of the group, came up with the upaj that the winner of the GBK question on the show deserved to be paid the prize money in demonetized Rs1,000 currency notes, preferably after 30 December. Elaborating on the commonly used “notes” (musical notes) as a translation for “swara”, other music lovers and musicians tweeted pictures of smiling musicians playing music with the message “Relax and Rejoice! Musical notes are still legal, even after mid-night today”, even as people rushed to ATM machines on the night of 8 November. WhatsApp buddies also shared news of the recent emergence of the brand new raga Dhan-khallas (the end of wealth) introduced by the Modi gharana of musicians. The upaj on demonetization is bound to continue with more clever quips being contributed by artistes, and hopefully everyone will retain their sense of humour and good cheer. But it is also essential to point out that while musicians often compliment each other on quick-witted repartee by saying “waah, kya achhi upaj hai”, the concept of upaj is no flippant laughing matter. It is in fact, a very serious and profound expression of creativity.

Mumbai: Unmindful of the growing political opposition and risk to the traditional political constituency of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday stepped up the ante in what he alluded to as the crusade against corruption.
				   
				Following up on the move to partially demonetize the currency undertaken last week, Modi warned of an imminent crackdown on benami properties—the enabling law came into effect on 1 November.“This would be a legislation-backed offensive against benami properties,” Modi said after he laid the foundation stone for Mopa greenfield airport and an electronic goods manufacturing city in Panaji.By positioning his fight against corruption as a means of empowering the poor, Modi has made it difficult for his political opponents—some of whom have called for a special discussion on the withdrawal of high-value bank notes in the upcoming winter session of Parliament.Claiming that the mandate in the general election of 2014—which gave the BJP a majority of its own in the Lok Sabha, the first for any political party in 30 years—was against corruption, Modi said he was bound to deliver on his electoral promise; and wouldn’t be discouraged by sustained attacks from the political opposition.“I have left home, family, everything for the nation,” Modi said in a choked voice before adding “he was not born for kursi (political chair).”In a tacit admission that the transition of currency demonetization is not going to plan, he made a direct appeal to people.“Please bear with me for 50 days and I promise I will give you the Hindustan that you have always wanted. I have unleashed this war on corruption and black money because of my faith in the honest people of this country and I want all honest people of my country to walk with me in this great war,” Modi said.“The world is progressing and this disease of black money and corruption is giving India a bad name. The future of 800 million Indian youths below the age of 35 is at stake and we owe this to them,” Modi said. Deploying his oratorical skills and flair for theatre, Modi sought the blessings of the people of Goa saying that they were a microcosm of the nation. After the speech, Modi, bowing and with folded hands, walked across the stage seeking people’s support.Without naming Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi, who on Friday stood in a queue to withdraw cash, Modi mocked the previous government for “2G scam, Koyla scam”, saying people involved in these scams were “lining up for 4000 rupees.” Modi applauded the patience being shown by people and bank employees for putting in long hours of work. “I am aware of the powers and people that have gone against me after this announcement. I am aware that they can destroy me and that they will be after my life. Let them do what they want but I am cleaning the dirt of 70 years. Please give me just fifty days,” Modi said in conclusionSenior journalist and commentator Prakash Joshi said Modi had used all his skills of rhetoric, theatre, and emotional messaging, to reach out directly to people. “He is a master at deploying this strategy and this is similar to how Indira Gandhi would react when cornered,”  Joshi said.Abhiram GhadyalpatilTopics: corruption Narendra Modi black money Rs500 notes Rs1000 notes

New Delhi: The government late on Sunday night announced further measures to ensure easy availability of cash to people, especially in the rural areas, after Prime Minister Narendra Modi chaired a late-night meeting of senior government officials.
				   
				The government has extended the usage of existing Rs.500 and Rs.1,000 notes for select transactions till 24 November from the earlier deadline of 14 November.This means that people can now use these notes at government hospitals, government-run cooperative shops, air-ticket counters, milk booths, petrol stations, burial grounds, international airports, to buy tickets at railway stations and for metro trains, to pay for medicines in government and private medical shops, to get cooking gas cylinders, and to pay court fees till 24 November. The usage of Rs.500 and Rs.1,000 notes has also been allowed for foreign tourists.Also read: Dear prime minister, the buck stops with youFurther, a task force will be set up under the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) deputy governor comprising officials of banks, RBI and the finance ministry, aimed at hastening the process of recalibration of ATMs, Shaktikanta Das, secretary, department of economic affairs in the finance ministry, told ANI.The ATMs have to be prepared to dispense the new Rs.500 and Rs.2,000 notes along with Rs.100 notes. But this whole process is expected to take around 2-3 weeks because of which many ATMs across the country are still not functioning.To ensure working capital needs of small businesses are met, the government has also permitted these entities to withdraw Rs.50,000 at a time from their current accounts that have been operational for at least three months.For ensuring cash availability in rural areas, the cash holding limits of business correspondents tasked with reaching far off areas will be increased to at least Rs.50,000. They will also be allowed to withdraw cash multiple times in a day. A large number of micro ATMs will also be pressed into service to enable withdrawals.Also read: Breaking the back of black moneyAll government departments have been asked to maximize electronic transactions. Banks and National Payments Corporation of India have also been asked to waive off all transaction fees for electronic transfers.Since announcing partial demonetization by cancelling the legal tender of the existing Rs.500 and Rs.1,000 notes, the government, RBI and the banks have been struggling to meet the cash requirements of the general public with widespread reports of long queues at banks and ATMs. The government has announced a number of measures over the last few days to ease the fund crunch, but it is expected to continue for the next few days, at least till all the ATMs begin functioning.Remya NairTopics: Narendra Modi demonetization cash transactions Rs.500 Rs.1000

New Delhi: Ten days after Prime Minister Narendra Modi government announced the demonetisation of Rs500 and Rs1,000 currency notes to fight black money, new rules have cropped up on cash withdrawals and bank deposits. The government has come up with rationing measures that are aimed at ensuring an equitable distribution of new currency notes. Many ATMs have started disbursing new Rs2,000 notes, but overall the supply of smaller denomination notes remains short. A shortage of Rs100 notes is sure to adversely impact a range of daily economic activities dependent on cash transactions. In addition, the ruling establishment’s crackdown on ways to prevent the hoarders from turning black money into white continues.
				   
				Here are the ten highlights of the day:1. Banks will not exchange decommissioned notes for non-bank non-bank customers on Saturday; senior citizens are exempted, says the Indian Banks Association2.Cash deposits by housewives, workers too will face tax scrutiny, says Finance ministry.3.The Supreme Court on Friday expressed reservation on Centre’s plea for direction that no court except apex court hears pleas on demonetisation notification.4.The Election Commission (EC) has raised its concern over the use of indelible ink to check multiple exchanges by people at different bank branches after the notes ban. Bye-elections for some Parliamentary and Assembly Constituencies are currently in progress and voting will be held on Saturday.5.Now 2,500 petrol pumps with SBI PoS terminals can disburse cash of up to a limit of Rs2,000 by swiping debit cards.6.Stamp duty collection in Maharashtra has dropped by 37% after the Centre demonetised high-value notes 10 days back.7.Beginning today, the amount of old Rs500 and Rs1000 notes that can be exchanged at bank branches is reduced to Rs2,000 for one person from Rs4,500.8.The revised withdrawal limit for wedding purposes stands at Rs2.5lakh from bank account of one family member, while farmers can withdraw up to Rs25,000 per week.9.Registered traders with APMC (agricultural produce market committee) can withdraw Rs50,000 per week to meet their sundry cash requirement, while Central government employees up to Group C can withdraw advance salary of Rs10,000 that will be adjusted from their November salary.10.The RBI has asked banks to waive off charges on all ATM transactions till 30 December.11.PAN is now mandatory for cash deposits above Rs50,000 in a day limiting the ability of tax evaders to make multiple deposits of less than Rs50,000 without providing their PAN—a common practice at present.

In times of trouble for gold—and the yellow metal has slid 11% over the past six week—India has traditionally provided a safety net. Indians typically account for between a fifth and a quarter of total global gold demand in the second half of the year, with bargain-hunting buyers putting a floor under prices when they fall too far. 
				   
				That’s particularly so in the period starting November, when most weddings take place. This year was expected to be different by some because of demonetisation, and this seemed borne out in the precipitous drop in prices over the past two months. But, interestingly, demonetisation seems to have had the opposite effect to what some suggested. Gold consumption didn’t weaken, or even hold steady in November. It boomed. That challenges the view that India has been a drag on gold over the past month. That supports anecdotes immediately after Narendra Modi’s announcement, suggesting the rush to convert expiring banknotes into alternative assets was helping rather than hindering gold demand. India’s love affair with gold may yet provide support to prices, particularly as the recent falls have driven the metal below the Rs30,000-per-10g level where local buyers come back to the market. But anyone hoping this will rescue the yellow metal from its current predicament may find themselves disappointed. Right now, investment funds spooked by the prospect of higher interest rates are selling faster than Indian consumers are buying. Until that dynamic levels out, gold’s road will be rocky.

Gurgaon: The government’s move to withdraw high-denomination bank notes to curb black money is a bold one, and even though it is a long-term positive, it can hurt equity markets for around six months, Christopher Wood, chief equity strategist and managing director of CLSA, said in an interview. He rates the Narendra Modi government an 8 on 10 on reforms delivery. Edited excerpts:
How do you perceive the government’s demonetization move?It is a dramatic and remarkable move. Normally, such a measure will happen in a country in the middle of a macroeconomic crisis and facing a hyperinflationary problem. But India is not facing such a crisis.Do you think this is the first in a series of moves to tackle the larger problem of black money?I would like to see this as part and parcel of the move to accelerate digital banking. That is the key structural thing. You had the drive to get everybody a bank account. The UIDAI programme has also has been continued. There is also the political angle of state elections next year.What are the negative implications?I think it is going to impact the economy in the next six months. But I am hoping it is short and sharp. The biggest negative is for the real estate market. It is negative for equities in the short term and positive for bonds.The question is how long will the pain remain (for equity markets)—six months or one year? I am hoping it’s six months, but that’s just an initial estimate. It all depends on how quickly they get the new money in place. If the new money comes in soon, things will not be so bad. If it goes beyond six months, the markets will be vulnerable.The real estate sector was already doing badly, that’s hit, but then it was already lying on the ground. Autos, cement and housing finance were doing well, and are now going to be hit.On the positive side, tax revenues will rise and this will help in reining in the fiscal deficit. The other benefit will be to the bond market and currency. The currency has been very stable and this will be a positive for it.How do you think the government’s move will impact the chances of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party in the state elections next year?It is a very bold move by the government because it could backfire. It is very risky. (With) any such move, you cannot be 100% sure if the practical implementation will work. How long it will take to deal with the inevitable teething issues.The Modi government will complete two-and-a-half years later this month. How do you assess its time in office?There have been dramatic reforms, but the big missing link has been that we have not had the big capitalization of state-run banks. It is still a work in progress.There has been a lot of pressure on banks to own up to the bad loans and there has been a lot of red ink reported. So, that is progress. I have been hoping that you will see consolidation of public sector banks. The setting up of the banking bureau is also a positive. But because the big recapitalization is missing, it is delaying economic recovery.But otherwise, demonetization is one of the biggest reforms. GST (goods and services tax) is in the works, bankruptcy is also a positive in the long term, but it will take many years. The law for regulating the property market is important.How will you rate the government on reforms?I will give the government an 8 out of 10.Is India still an attractive investment destination?India is still a very attractive destination on a long-term basis. It is not the best market in the next three months. The key thing to watch out will be how deep and how long the economic fallout from this attack on cash will last.Will this move impact corporate earnings as well?The market was expecting corporate earnings to pick up, but that is being delayed now. I am hoping that it is not more than six months. If it does not resolve within that time, then the market is very vulnerable.What do you make of Donald Trump’s victory?It does not mean anything for India, as it is more dependent on the domestic story. The impact on the other emerging markets so far is that the US bond market is sold off, and that has led to pressure on emerging market debt, which is selling off. People made a lot of money in emerging market bonds this year, and are now rushing to sell. However, the Indian debt market is not the worst-hit. Indian equities, right now, are completely driven by the domestic development of demonetization.Investment demand has not picked up in India. When do you think that will pick up?In terms of investment cycle, there are three areas that can get it up. The first is government-driven infrastructure, which is happening; capital expenditure, which is still low; and the third one is real estate, which has taken a hit. So, the investment cycle is not going to recover anytime soon.A lot of IPOs with unique propositions hit the market this year. What are your thoughts on the same?The more important asset class that is emerging in India is stressed debt. To me, that is more interesting than the IPOs. That’s a sign that the banking system is beginning to get cleaned up.We had a change of guard at the Reserve Bank of India. Your views?Monetary policy is easier under Urjit Patel, but I am hoping that the pressure on the banks to clean up their books is maintained.ami shah & remya nairRemya NairTopics: demonetization markets impact Christopher Wood stock markets black money

The Indian government’s decision to demonetize currency notes of Rs500 and Rs1,000 was necessitated by the increase in difficult-to-tell counterfeit notes and a desire to curb black income generation as well as eliminating a part of existing unaccounted wealth held in these high-denomination notes. The authorities’ intent and action are indeed praiseworthy but need to be followed up with subsequent actions to remain effective. These actions relate mainly to structural changes to make the system more rules-based—reduce the discretionary powers of the bureaucracy, make the tax system simple, transparent and less discretionary, make a greater effort to include the informal sector and ensure effective and quick dispensation of justice. Meanwhile, the impact on the economy will most certainly be negative and could reduce potential gross domestic product (GDP) in the medium term and consequently government revenue. 
				   
				The government, by announcing a tax amnesty scheme before demonetization, has sent a strong signal to tax evaders to declare their incomes in future and avoid evading taxes. This would help enhance the tax base going forward and help reduce the fiscal deficit. However, at the same time, revenue growth is likely to be negatively affected as a result of slower growth.In the short term, there will be an increase in bank deposits as individuals deposit their high-denomination notes, bringing down yields. This may, however, not sustain as people may have a desire to hold and move back to cash in the new high-denomination notes that will become available over time. The impact of the demonetization measures would certainly be slower economic growth. As most real-estate transactions entail an element of cash, this market is likely to come to a standstill with property prices likely to fall. This would imply a negative-wealth effect leading to a decline in consumption, and possibly business investment.Several businesses transact in cash and with demonetization they may become cash-strapped, hurting business—and consequently revenue, employment, consumption and investment. The informal sector in India employs more than a majority of the workers and most transactions are in cash. Disruption to this system could endanger the employment and livelihood of weaker sections of society.The likely tax investigations following demonetization will affect domestic spending adversely—both consumption and investment in the formal and informal sectors. This would be true as tax laws remain open to interpretation at the mercy of the tax authorities with no real effective legal recourse. The reduction in overall investments, both in the formal and informal sectors, would reduce potential GDP growth. The authorities need to come up with a stimulatory fiscal spending programme, especially aimed at alleviating the pain in the informal sector, coupled with a weaker exchange rate to compensate for the sharp contraction in money supply. While meaningful structural reforms remain elusive to increase economic growth, the contractionary monetary policy unleashed without a compensating expansionary fiscal- or exchange-rate policy would have a negative impact. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI), which needs to allow a stimulatory weaker exchange rate, has been doing just the opposite since the announcement of demonetization—it has been letting the rupee appreciate in real effective exchange-rate terms. Unaccounted wealth certainly continues to exist in the form of assets such as property investments and gold, and black income could again be generated if the government does not undertake steps to reduce the incentives for evading taxes. Structural reforms to make the economic transactions more transparent are, therefore, necessary to sustain the government’s current initiative.A clear, transparent, rule-based system is essential to reduce the discretionary and, hence, the rent-seeking abilities of government officials. Corrupt officials are unlikely to give up on seeking rent for their personal benefit because of their ability to construe rules as they deem fit.More transparent and open electronic-bidding systems as well as allocation decisions and their basis need to be made public to reduce this menace. Similarly, with lack of clarity and multiple tax rates, corrupt revenue officials will remain open to bribes. Rule of law is critical for a well-functioning economy. India’s judicial system suffers from several weaknesses that embolden individuals engaged in black-money generation. Additionally, the pendency in courts and years taken to decide most cases discourages honest people from taking on dishonest officials and end up paying them. Reform in the judicial system has been held up and the government needs to fix this through hiring of judges, greater use of information technology in courts and reducing cases where government is a litigant (most outstanding cases in Indian courts today).If illegal activities (smuggling, drug trafficking) as well as corruption continue, black income will be generated in future. This will be funnelled back into the economy and receivers of this—firms, businesses—will again have to hide these revenues from tax authorities. Generation of black income and, consequently, wealth cannot be eliminated without simple, transparent rules and a rule of law essential for a society to function well-being implemented in earnest. The authorities need to move further in that direction.

Singapore: Any move by the Indian government to treat currency that is not surrendered during the ongoing demonetization process as a profit will be “ill-advised,” former Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor D. Subbarao has warned.
				   
				Speaking at MintAsia’s global banking conclave in Singapore, Subbarao cited speculation that the Indian government could use the currency that is not returned to solve its fiscal problems or to recapitalize banks, but pointed out that such a step would send out the wrong message.“Then demonetization will be viewed as being done with other motives, rather than fighting black money,” Subbarao said.“For argument’s sake, let us assume that a quarter of the Rs500 and Rs1,000 currency notes in circulation does not come back—this is equivalent to about Rs3.5 trillion, and can be considered as a windfall profit for the RBI. By law, the central bank has to transfer all its profit to the government. If RBI treats this as a profit, and the Centre demands that this be transferred to it, and they use this to play Robin Hood or to recapitalize the banks, or for whatever other purposes, this will send out the wrong message. I don’t believe that this is the intention of the current government, but if they were to do such a thing, it will be highly ill-advised,” he said.ALSO READ | Demonetization: Will it hurt growth?Subbarao also said that he was unsure about the legal position on whether the RBI could claim unreturned currency as profit.According to him, all currency notes carry a legal obligation, as the “RBI has guaranteed that it will pay the bearer the sum or the value of the denomination that is printed on that note.”“The government has not used the word demonetization. All that the government has said is that it is withdrawing these notes as being legal tender. But it still leaves us with the question: does the RBI have the obligation to pay the bearer, or is that obligation over, after the government announcement,” he added.At the same time, the former central bank governor said the positives of the current demonetization drive outweighed the negatives.ALSO READ | Demonetization is a hollow move“If you ride out the short-term pain, the positives will be substantial, be in terms of attracting investments, and also getting people to move from physical cash to electronic transactions,” he said, adding that the benefits would only be realized in full if the government followed this drive to its logical conclusion.He said that the money being deposited in the banks, as against having it “in the pocket, or under the pillow”, was good for the economy.“Banks will multiply the money when it is with them. It will encourage banks to get lending rates down, even if the RBI does not ease any further…. demonetization will also help improve financial inclusion... banks will be able to give out more credit and all this will have a multiplier effect,” he said.Asked about the implications of the election of Donald Trump as US president, Subbarao said if the US were to adopt a more protectionist economic policy, renegotiate trade deals and impose controls on immigration, these steps would have an impact on both India and the rest of Asia.“We don’t know to what extent he will act on these steps. But if he were to be protectionist, the Americans will see that costs will actually go up. My fear is that Americans will see prices go up without fresh jobs being created. The American economy will not perform well—some of the corporates operating outside the US will take investments back, and that will be negative for India. Trump’s impact on the Fed is the most unknown and is the most risky. Any attempt by any powerful leader to tamper with issues that impact financial stability will have a large impact on not just the American economy, but also emerging economies,” he added.Joji Thomas PhilipTopics: D Subbarao RBI demonetization black money currency notes

The double whammy of demonetization and the election of Donald Trump as US president has unnerved the Indian equity market and the Nifty is down 3.8% from its 9 November close. 
				   
				How much of that is due to the Trump effect and how much on account of the deflationary impact of demonetization?The accompanying chart provides some clues. The biggest fall has been in the Nifty Realty index, which, for obvious reasons, bears the brunt of demonetization.The next biggest fall has been in the Nifty FMCG index, which too, analysts say, will be affected temporarily due to the disruption in cash payments. Click here for enlargePartly, the sector’s high valuations may have led to some selling. The IT index, directly related to the Trump effect, hasn’t really fallen by much. On the other hand, the metal index has more or less held its ground, thanks to the perception that Trump’s spending on infrastructure will raise prices of industrial metals. The pharma index has been a good defensive bet, partly in the hope that Trump will be more liberal about pricing.In short, so far the demonetization impact seems to be weighing on Indian equity markets more than the Trump effect.LivemintTopics: Demonetization Donald Trump market impact BSE Sensex Nifty

Emerging markets have been hit by rising bond yields in the US after the election of Donald Trump as president. At the same time, the Indian market has been affected by demonetization. One way to isolate the impact of demonetization is therefore to consider the premium valuations that the Indian market enjoys vis-à-vis its peers in Asia. The accompanying chart plots this premium that the MSCI India Index has over MSCI Asia ex-Japan Index.
				   
				As the chart shows, the premium has come down since 8 November. MSCI India’s one-year forward price-to-earnings (P-E) multiple was 16.85 on 8 November, compared to 12.84 for MSCI Asia-Pacific ex-Japan. By 6 December, MSCI India’s P-E was at 15.9 compared to 12.59 for MSCI Asia-Pacific ex-Japan. Clearly, the Indian market’s P-E has fallen much more than that for the Asia-Pacific ex-Japan markets. That compression in the India premium is the impact of demonetization. LivemintTopics: Indian markets valuation demonetization Emerging markets Donald Trump

Most of the country and even foreigners are going gaga over the move by the government to demonetize high-denomination notes. A presumption has been made that they mostly reflect black money or unaccounted wealth. A bold move indeed and there are many who have been caught unawares with a bagful of notes. However, the question is: does it fundamentally change the dynamic of corruption or does it have only cosmetic value? Here is a look at it from a slightly different perspective.
				   
				Unaccounted wealth in the form of cash stashed away is only the tip of the iceberg, so to speak. The move itself would target at the most 5% of the population, while the pain will be felt by 95%, albeit for a few days. Take the example of the daily wage earner who does not get paid and cannot feed his family, as cash is not available. Or the rehriwalla who goes around without selling his wares which could be perishable. For them, it was more like carpet-bombing on the cash economy rather than a surgical strike on black money! It’s a predominately cash economy without access to plastic money or banks. As someone remarked, “Has the Indian economy gone on holiday” for the past few days, and maybe another week or so? What of the consequences? Consider the number of man-hours lost with people standing in long queues and often coming back disappointed as the branch ran out of currency. But the people say that they don’t mind the pain as long as the ‘black’ money goes extinct.Really? Is it that simple? This cash is only the tip of the iceberg and most of the parallel economy is embedded in real estate/jewellery/bullion or in tax havens. Money is always being USED and very little is wasted by keeping it idle. This move is akin to giving an aspirin to a sick person to cool the temperature without treating the underlying disease. What if the pain is not just long lines, but a sharp downturn in growth or even contraction? What if the pain is less job growth? What if the pain is to drive the ‘black’ money deeper underground?The disease is the system itself which feeds a parallel economy. The major contributors are:* Elections and the loads of cash needed for canvassing. Solution: can they be funded by the state or the expenditure be closely monitored?* Real estate and the cash element in almost all transactions. Circle rates do not reflect the real cost of the property which is almost universally known in the locality. The financial intelligence wing should be able to gather this information and use it.* Wedding expenditure or let’s call it an industry with all stakeholders taking a cut and the consequent need to keep cash. We could clamp down on this without too much ado.* Rent-seeking attitude of many government departments wanting a handout for doing their job or ignoring contraventions. The list is endless, and needless to say, the cure has to come from the top. Example: everyone knows that it is almost impossible to get a completion certificate for a new construction in Delhi and yet the racket continues to flourish. Hence, the need to keep cash on hand unless timelines are set to decide.* Non-issue of bills of sale or inflating purchases is the classic way of suppressing income. Hopefully, with the advent of the goods and services tax, the need to take credit shall minimize this.Criminal activity covering a whole range of rackets would have to be tackled and political patronage withdrawn.Therefore, mere demonetization would not serve the purpose. It would have to be taken in conjunction with other measures to correct systemic faults and not just the present isolated destruction of cash. This would only be a temporary relief (laudable that fake currency would be destroyed), but it would not put an end to the future generation of black money.Even as I write, numerous fellows with IDs are being deployed to encash Rs4,000 repeatedly and the gold/bullion dealers have already made a killing. Another window is the deposit of Rs2 lakh, which would go under the radar, and many would oblige for a fee.While in the Central Board of Direct Taxes, I had recommended the adoption of the South Korean cash card system. Perhaps, the argument then that we did not have the infrastructure was credible, but the country may be ready for it now. South Korea had hugely augmented its tax collections in the last Asian crisis through proper reporting of expenditure even in cash. Swiping a card at a point of sale could capture all expenditure—above $5/7, made by cash. We could set the limit at Rs30,000 and use PAN for reporting.Of course, such a system would need augmenting with structural reforms of the real estate sector, political party financing and other sources of black money. As it is, demonetization is a red herring with real pain for those who can least carry the burden.B.M. Singh is former chairman of the Central Board of Direct Taxes.B.M.

New Delhi: The winter session of Rajya Sabha opened on Wednesday with a united opposition mounting an assault on the government over demonetization, saying it had led to “economic anarchy” in the country and alleged selective leak of the information before the announcement which should be probed by a Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC).
				   
				The government rejected as baseless the opposition charge that there was “leakage” of the 8 November decision and said everyone was taken by surprise which is why there are “initial” problems.Joining ranks over the raging issue, parties like Congress, Janata Dal (United), Rashtriya Janata Dal, Samajwadi Party, Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), Trinamool Congress, Left and All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) slammed the government, particularly targeting Prime Minister Narendra Modi, for making Rs500 and Rs1,000 denomination notes invalid and said the “ill-timed” and “ill-conceived” step had severely hit the common people, the farmers and the poor. During a discussion on demonetization, which was taken up after suspension of all business in response to notices given by a host of opposition members, a scathing attack was made on the government which strongly defended the step as one taken in national interest and to end corruption and black money, which it linked to terror activities in the country.Alleging that the information had been leaked to BJP units and ‘friends of BJP’, a number of opposition parties demanded a Joint Parliamentary Committee probe into it. During the course of 7-hour debate which remained inconclusive, there were repeated demands by the opposition members that the prime minister should be present in the House to listen to the members. Leader of opposition Ghulam Nabi Azad said Modi, who did not come to the Rajya Sabha today, should at least be present tomorrow and possibly intervene.Initiating the debate, Congress leader Anand Sharma used wit and humour to attack Modi, saying he was “insensitive” to problems caused to the common man. The “ill-timed” and “ill-conceived” move has unleashed “economic anarchy” in the country and benefited a few, he said. “Your government is insensitive,” he said, adding Modi was riding a bullet train in Japan when old, women and common man were queueing up at banks at 3 am to get currency to buy their daily needs. Questioning the government’s contention that the step was taken to end the menace of black money, the former Union minister said a bigger Rs2,000 note has been brought which is similar to the paper on which ‘churan’ is sold and “sheds colour”. Sharma alleged that the information on demonetisation was selectively leaked.  “Your BJP units have deposited crores of rupees (just before the November 8 decision),” he said. He quoted some media reports to support his allegation, saying State Bank of India - the country’s largest lender - knew of the decision way back in March and a Gujarati newspaper had in April published a report of move to withdraw 500 and 1000 rupee notes.PTITopics: Demonetization Rajya Sabha Narendra Modi Opposition BJP

Automobile shares were hurt by the move to withdraw Rs500 and Rs1,000 notes, with the BSE Auto index closing with a loss of 2.5% on Wednesday. 
				   
				The disclosure of PAN (Permanent Account Number) while buying vehicles had already been made mandatory except for two-wheelers, so cash deals are not so rampant in the sector. Hence, the move may not have as adverse an impact on sales as some other sectors, according to analysts. But unaccounted for money is reportedly in circulation in the luxury car segment, which may see a slowdown due to the withdrawal. However, two-wheeler sales, more so in the rural market, are known to be driven by cash transactions. Rural markets account for a significant portion of two-wheeler, mainly motorcycle, sales. This segment may take a temporary hit if consumers take time to move to official channels of making payments, such as credit cards or cheque payments.Thus, there may be a near-term drop in sales volumes because of the disruption caused by the withdrawal of existing Rs500 and Rs1,000 notes. But this comes in the backdrop of reviving consumer demand that has seen sales growth improve for cars and two-wheelers. Thus, this may not be more than a small speed bump in their path.Staff WriterTopics: Rs500 Rs1000 rupee notes demonetization car sales

The Indian economy’s heavy dependence on cash is likely to worsen its pain following the government’s decision to scrap Rs500 and Rs1,000 notes. 
				   
				The importance of cash in India can be seen from the fact that the country has a much higher cash-to-gross domestic product (GDP) ratio than most major economies. Even in terms of cash-deposit ratio, India is much ahead of the US and euro zone. While some of this could be due to hoarding of undisclosed income, India’s huge informal economy is also a major factor in the dominance of cash in day-to-day transactions.Low average balance in Jan Dhan Yojana accounts suggests that those dependent on the informal economy might not have been using bank facilities regularly and are most vulnerable to the transition costs.Click here for enlargeLivemintTopics: demonetization Rs500 note Rs1000 notes note ban cash-deposit ratio

Mumbai: Banks received Rs.5,44,571 crore in deposits and old notes submitted for exchange from the time banks reopened after currency demonetisation till 18 November, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) said.
				   
				This includes deposits of Rs.5,11,565 crore and exchanged currency notes of Rs.33,006 crore, the central bank said in a statement on its website. The figures were reported by RBI counters, regional rural banks and urban cooperative banks.“They (banks) have also reported that the public have withdrawn, during this period, Rs 1,03,316 crore from their accounts either over the counter or through ATMs (automated teller machines),” the statement said.Customers are allowed to withdraw up to Rs.2,500 per day through ATMs and Rs.24,000 a week from their savings accounts at bank branches by issuing cheques and other such instruments. In a separate notification on Monday, the RBI said that customers will be allowed to withdraw Rs.50,000 per week, through their current accounts, overdraft facilities and cash credit accounts. India’s largest lender State Bank of India (SBI) on Friday said it had received Rs.1.27 trillion worth of cash deposits and saw exchanges worth Rs.6,477 crore. The bank also reported withdrawals worth Rs.23,340 crore.Vishwanath NairTopics: RBI banks bank deposits demonetisation cash withdrawal
