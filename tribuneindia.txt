Prime Minister Narendra Modi handpicked a trusted bureaucrat, little known outside India’s financial circles, to spearhead a radical move to abolish 86 per cent of the country’s cash overnight and take aim at the huge shadow economy.
Hasmukh Adhia, the bureaucrat, and five others privy to the plan were sworn to utmost secrecy, say sources with knowledge of the matter. They were supported by a young team of researchers working in two rooms at Modi’s New Delhi residence, as he plotted his boldest reform since coming to power in 2014.
When announced, the abolition of high-value bank notes of Rs 500 and 1,000 ($7.50 and $15) came as a bolt from the blue.

The secrecy was aimed at outflanking those who might profit from prior knowledge, by pouring cash into gold, property and other assets and hide illicit wealth.
Previously unreported details of Modi’s handling of the so-called “demonetization” open a window onto the hands-on role he played in implementing a key policy, and how he was willing to act quickly even when the risks were high.
While some advocates say the scrapping of the bank notes will bring more money into the banking system and raise tax revenues, millions of Indians are furious at having to queue for hours outside banks to exchange or deposit their old money.
Labourers have also been unpaid and produce has rotted in markets as cash stopped changing hands. Not enough replacement notes were printed in preparation for the upheaval, and it could take months for things to return to normal.
With India’s most populous state, Uttar Pradesh, holding an election in early 2017 that could decide Modi’s chances of a second term in office, there is little time for the hoped-for benefits of his cash swap to outweigh short-term pain.
Modi has staked his reputation and popularity on the move.
“I have done all the research and, if it fails, then I am to blame,” Modi told a cabinet meeting on November 8 shortly before the move was announced, according to three ministers who attended.
Direct line to Modi
Overseeing the campaign, with support from the backroom team camped out at Modi’s sprawling bungalow in the capital, was Adhia, a top finance ministry official.
The 58-year-old served as principal secretary to Modi from 2003-06 when he was chief minister of Gujarat, establishing a relationship of trust with his boss and introducing him to yoga.
Colleagues interviewed by Reuters said he had a reputation for integrity and discretion.
Adhia was named revenue secretary in September 2015, reporting formally to Finance Minister Arun Jaitley. In reality, he had a direct line to Modi and they would speak in their native Gujarati when they met to discuss issues in depth.
In the world’s largest democracy the demonetisation was revolutionary: it called into question the state’s promise to “pay the bearer” the face value on every bank note.
At a stroke, Modi scrapped money worth 15.4 trillion rupees ($220 billion), equal to 86 per cent of cash in Asia’s third-largest economy.
The idea is backed by some economists, although the speed of its implementation is widely seen as radical.
“One is never ready for this kind of disruption, but it is a constructive disruption," said Narendra Jadhav, a 31-year veteran and former chief economist of India's central bank who now represents Modi's party in the Upper House of Parliament.
Modi, in his TV address to the nation, cautioned that people could face temporary hardship as replacement Rs 500 and 2,000 notes were introduced. Calling for an act of collective sacrifice, he promised steps to soften the blow for the nine in 10 Indians who live in the cash economy.
‘Biggest, boldest step’
Immediately after the address, Adhia sent a tweet: "This is the biggest and the boldest step by the Government for containing black money."
The boast harked back to Modi's election vow to recover black money from abroad that had resonated with voters fed up with the corruption scandals that plagued the last Congress government. Yet in office, he struggled to keep his promise.
Over more than a year, Modi commissioned research from officials at the finance ministry, the central bank and think-tanks on how to advance his fight against black money, a close aide said.
He demanded answers to questions such as: How quickly India could print new bank notes; how to distribute them; would state banks benefit if they received a rush of new deposits; and who would gain from demonetisation?
The topics were broken up to prevent anyone from joining the dots and concluding that a cash swap was in the offing.
"We didn't want to let the cat out of the bag," said a senior official directly involved. "Had people got a whiff of the decision, the whole exercise would have been meaningless." Under Adhia's oversight, the team of researchers assembled and modelled the findings in what was, for it, a theoretical exercise.
It was made up of young experts in data and financial analysis; some ran Modi's social media accounts and a smartphone app that he used to solicit public feedback.
Yet for all the planning, Modi and Adhia knew they could not foresee every eventuality, and were willing to move swiftly.
The announcement caused chaos, with huge queues forming at banks when they reopened after a short holiday.
New Rs 2,000 notes were hard to come by and barely any new Rs 500 notes had been printed. India's 200,000 cash dispensers could not handle the new, smaller, notes and it would take weeks to reconfigure them.
Filling ATMs with the 8 trillion rupees ($117 billion) in new bank notes that the finance ministry reckons are needed to restore liquidity to the economy is even trickier.
In a best-case scenario, in which India's four bank note presses churned out new Rs 500 and 2,000 notes designed to replace the abolished ones, it would take at least three months to hit that target.
Secrecy paramount
Secrecy was paramount, but clues had been left.
Back in April, analysts at State Bank of India said that demonetisation of large-denomination notes was possible.
The Reserve Bank of India, the central bank, also disclosed in May that it was making preparations for a new series of bank notes that were confirmed in August when it announced it had approved a design for a new Rs 2,000 note.
The printing presses had only just started turning when the media finally started to run with the story in late October.
"The plan was to introduce it around November 18, but there was a clear sign that it could get leaked," said one person with direct knowledge who, like others interviewed by Reuters, asked not to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter.
Some officials in the finance ministry had expressed doubts about scrapping high-value notes when the idea came up for discussion. They now feel resentment at the secrecy in which Adhia rammed through the plan on Modi's orders.
They also say the plan was flawed because of a failure to ramp up printing of new notes ahead of time.
Other critics say the Adhia team fell prey to a form of "group think" that ignored outside advice.
In the words of one former top official who has worked at the finance ministry and central bank: "They don't know what's happening in the real world." Reuters

New Delhi, November 23
Congress vice president Rahul Gandhi, leading the protest against demonetisation in Parliament, on Wednesday said the party wanted a joint parliamentary committee probe into the “scam” involving prior leakage of the decision to a select few in the BJP.
Insisting on opposition unity moments after 12 parties joined hands to lead a protest against the move in Parliament House, the Amethi MP said all leaders also wanted Prime Minister Narendra Modi to come to Parliament, listen to them and tell the nation why he took a decision that “hit the people and economy”.

After the joint opposition protest, Rahul described demonetisation of high-denomination currency as the biggest impromptu financial experiment in the world saying the decision had hit the Indian economy. He also alleged that the Finance Minister or the Chief Economic Adviser did not know of the move, adding that the BJP organisations in Bengal and other places knew of that which explained why bank deposits surged on the eve of the announcement on November 8.
Asked how the BJP organisations could have known of the move when the FM did not, Gandhi said, “BJP organisations knew so did a few industrialist friends of the PM.”
Earlier, the Gandhi scion took swipes at the PM for addressing a pop concert and “naach gaana” saying, “The PM can give lectures to a pop concert where naach gaana is going on. Over 200 MPs are saying they want to tell the nation why he took this decision. The PM does not want to come to Parliament. Why is the PM afraid of going inside Parliament? He is obviously anxious about something.”
Gandhi said there was no division in the opposition camp about demands around demonetization, adding, “First of all we want the PM, who represents the country, to come to Parliament. He should sit in the debate. He will have to listen to us, will have to sit there. Second, we see a scam behind this move. The PM and the BJP president told their own people of the scam. We need a JPC to probe that. You see cent per cent united opposition standing here. Over 200 MPs are here. We are united. The PM should tell us why he has taken this decision.”
Gandhi said all opposition parties were fighting against black money but the question is why one decision should harass one billion people.
“It’s a question of complete centralisation of power. The country cannot be run in this manner. You have hit the economy. The economy was working well, though not as well as in the UPA time. Bengal and Kerala fishermen industry has been finished, small traders have been hit. Have you seen anyone in suit-boot in the queues?” Gandhi said accusing the PM of unilaterally taking the demonetization decision.
Asked who is leading the protest from the opposition side considering BSP chief Mayawati and SP chief Muyalam Singh were not personally part of the opposition protest on Wednesday though their MPs came, Rahul said poor people’s voice is leading this protest and MPs are representing that voice.
He said it was shameful that 70 people had died following the move and Parliament had not made any obituary reference to them.
The Congress remained adamant on its demand for an adjournment motion debate on the issue in Lok Sabha with Rahul saying, “The PM is afraid of allowing an adjournment motion.”
The government says it is ready to debate demonetisation under Rule 193 which does not entail voting unlike an adjournment notice under Rule 56 of the LS procedures.

Dharamsala, December 21
Chief Minister Virbhadra Singh today termed the demonetization as financial emergency. 
While speaking on a debate on problems being faced by the people of state due to demonetization in the Himachal Assembly today the Chief Minister said that former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, who is also a noted economist, had termed the demonetization move a monumental blunder. The Nobel Laureate in Economics from India Amritya Sen had termed the demonetisation as despotic action.
He said that the people of state were suffering as there was little cash in banks and ATMs. 
Traders, taxi operators and the tourism sector in Himachal have been hit hard. Horticulturists from Himachal were suffering as their produce was not been sold in fruit and vegetable markets. 
Almost all the trade in vegetables and fruits was in cash and now the farmers are facing problems. The prices of their produce have fallen and they are likely to face losses, he said.
The people are also facing problems due to the high denomination notes of Rs 2,000. There was no change available. He said the state government had requested the union government to increase the limit for cash being given for marriages from Rs 2.5 lakh to Rs 5 lakh. 
The state government had also provided its helicopter for transfer of cash to remote areas of the state so that the people do not face problems. The union government should immediately provide cash in the system so that the people do not face hardships.
Sanjay Rattan, Congress MLA from Jawalamukhi who had initiated the debate, said that the decision to demonetize 85 per cent of currency was announced in the middle of night by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. 
The people are facing problems since then. The people having marriages in their families have been allowed cash withdrawal of Rs 2.5 lakh. Even for that amount a lot of riders have been added. 
“I had given Rs 12,000 cheque to my driver, but the bank gave him just Rs 3,000 despite the fact that he had medical emergency in family”. He said if the BJP was so confident about success of demonetization it should go for re-election.
Ajay Mahajan, Congress MLA from Nurpur, said that though the government was pushing people towards the digital economy there have been rise in cyber crimes in the country. The digital transactions were prone to cyber crimes. About 100 people have lost their lives due to demonetization and only the PM was to blame for it.
Mohan Lal Bragta, Congress MLA, said that the tourism industry in Himachal had been badly hit due to demonetization.  Kuldeep Kumar, Congress MLA, said that during the elections the PM had promised to bring back black money stashed in foreign banks but nothing of this sort happened. 
Ram Kumar, Congress MLA, said that demonetization had hit the labourers and transporters in Baddi the industrial belt of the state. Only Congress members participated in the debate on demonetization today as the Opposition had left the House.

Rewari, January 9
Workers of the Congress Women Cell today organised a demonstration by beating plates against demonetisation here. The protesters shouted slogans against the BJP government and decried the demonetization. They said that it had paralysed the normal life as people had to struggle to withdraw their money from banks.
Earlier, the protesters gathered at the residence of former minister Capt Ajay Yadav and castigated Prime Minister Narendra Modi for scrapping the notes of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 without thinking about its consequences.
Karnal: Women activists of the district Congress took out a protest march in the city by beating plates over the problems being faced by people due to demonetisation.
They said that the women were the worst sufferers as they had to manage their kitchen and other expenditures, including fee of their children, rent, grocery etc with limited money.
State secretary Rekha Gurjar and women Congress leader Santosh Karalia led the protest and said that due to demonetisation, all sections of society were badly affected.
The government should lift the restriction on withdrawing money from banks with immediate effect, they demanded.
Yamunanagar: Congress workers and leaders held a demonstration against demonetisation at the Mini-Secretariat here.
The protesters were led by Rajya Sabha member Viplove Thakur, SS Lakki and Om Prakash Devinagar. They also submitted a memorandum to Deputy Commissioner SS Phulia to be forwarded to the President.
Thakur said that demonetisation had adversely affected every person of the country. Among others, Satpal Kaushik, Bhupinder Rana, Subhash Chaudhry, BL Saini, Krishna Pandit, Devinder Chawala, Bhupal Bhatti and Suresh Dhandha, also took part in the protest.

The year 2016 brought with it a bitter reality check for the start-up industry in India. The frenzied investment activity that had marked 2015 slowed down considerably. The funding crunch began to bite. It has affected those that have no clear business model or differentiation from rival ventures.
“We have a plethora of challenges facing the industry. But, demonetization is certainly not one of them. In fact, the push for digital economy has had a positive impact on the start-ups that are operating in the e-payment space,” said a Hyderabad-based entrepreneur engaged in financial technology services sector.
In fact, within a week of demonetisation announcement, PayTM had garnered 700% hike in traffic, 300% surge in app downloads and about 1000% enhancement in saved money in its wallet facility.
Positive impact
“More and more merchants are now ready to embrace digital payments,” says Vinay Kalantri, managing director, The Mobile Wallet. “We are confident that demonetization and cashless transactions will expand the country’s economy, boost the banking sector and curb the circulation of fake currency and black money,” said Sudhakar Ram, CEO and co-founder, Benow.
The fact that now money will become formal and white will give rise to a greater number of electronic transactions. Startups will find it easier to collect and pay money, be it those startups that run on an aggregation model or ones that run on a delivery model.
“Black money and cash money is something that couldn’t go into startups as investments. Now, with more money coming into the formal economy, people will start looking at more avenues of investment and this would greatly help startups who are seeking funding. Next year, we’ll see an increase in the number of businesses using cloud-based solutions for online sales,” said Francesco Cetraro, head of operations for .Cloud.
So many challengesStart-ups lack a support system, early-stage mentorship, investor connects and viable exits. “One of the problems with Indian startups is that they are not solving problems of India. E-commerce was a big success in the US because it really was needed at that point. We have copy-pasted these ideas in India,” says Jay Krishnan, the CEO of T-hub, billed as India’s largest start-up incubator. It is a Public Private Partnership (PPP) between Telangana government and premier academic institutes such as IIIT-Hyderabad, Indian School of Business (ISB) and NALSAR.
Several startups struggled as investors tightened their purse strings, either because they were not convinced about a business model, or were looking to monetize their existing portfolio. Funding crunch became one of the most heard terms this year. 
The total number of startups that got funding fell by over 27% compared to 2015 while the total disclosed value of funding deals dropped by almost 42%.
“It is uncannily difficult to start a business in India. Myriad laws and regulations means it takes about 30 days to comply compared to just 9 days in Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries. The OECD is a group of 34-member countries that discuss and develop economic and social policy. OECD members are democratic countries that support free market economies.
The government’s role has so far been limited to giving out grants and loans, but without an effective, enabling environment, implementation is far off the target. In this regard, it will be interesting to see the contours of the recently announced Startup Fund in this year’s budget. For startups to thrive and succeed, the government has a lot to do and understand the importance of entrepreneurship in economic development.
“Capital and access to capital has been a perennial problem for startups. While, of late angel investors, venture capital and private equity have brought succor to some extent, a large number of startups still grapple to raise funds from institutional setup. Funding challenge is not merely limited to seed rounds,” says Ashish Mittal, founder and chief mentor at Turning Ideas.
Need for paradigm shift
Since India has a unique set of problems, the replication of Silicon Valley model of start-ups will not work. “At T-Hub, we have chosen six key sectors to incubate startups, and all of them were chosen based on the strengths of Hyderabad as a city. Health technology, agricultural technology, financial technology, transport and logistics, sustainability and social sector are the areas,” says Jay Krishnan of T-hub.
“Indian startups are more about euphoria and less about substance, and they just chase capital rather than being the next frontier in technology. Most of them have a sense of entitlement and think they should get funding just because they have an idea,” says Ravi Bhogu of Monitra Healthcare. The company builds health monitoring devices which can be used by the patient easily, while carrying on with daily life.

Shimla, December 5
Himachal Pradesh Congress Committee (HPCC) president Sukhwinder Singh Sukhu today criticised Prime Minister Narendra Modi for not properly planning and implementing the demonetization of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 currency notes. He was addressing a public meeting in Theog as part of “Panchayat Ek - Vikas Anek” programme launched by the party. Irrigation and Public Health (IPH) Minister Vidya Stokes, who is MLA from Theog, also addressed the gathering.
Sukhu said the BJP government had announced demonetization of currency notes of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 without any planning which has caused inconvenience to common man whether it is farmer, small trader, labourer or general public. “For the last 27 days when the demonetisation was started, general public is forced to stand in queues for hours to withdraw their hard-earned money as 86 per cent currency was declared invalid legal tender by Modi government,” he said.
He accused the Modi government of divulging the details of demonetisation before hand. The BJP had bought land across the country worth crores of rupees a few days before the implementation of decision. “There are reports that many BJP leaders have made several land deals and the deeds of 10 such transactions were done by BJP functionaries on behalf of the higher-ups”.
He further stated that under “Panchayat Anek- Vikas Anek” program, conventions would be organized in all 3,236 panchayats, 251 zila parishad wards and 52 notified area committees across the state to spread awareness about Congress party’s ideology, the state government’s achievements and also the achievements of successive Congress government’s at the Centre.

New Delhi, December 6
Chief Minister Harish Rawat today criticised Prime Minister Narendra Modi over demonetization and said two to three more such “fatwas” would see the Congress return to power at the Centre in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections under the “capable” leadership of Rahul Gandhi.
He raised questions over the Union government’s commitment towards “cooperative federalism” at ‘Agenda Aaj Tak’ summit organised by the news channel here. He accused the Prime Minister of “not trying to understand the pain” of non-BJP states, which he claimed, were struggling to get Central funds.
“Barring a few, every person is feeling the pinch of demonetisation. The move has blighted the economy and lives of common people. If the Prime Minister takes a few more such decisions, issues such as fatwas (edicts), people will find Rahul Gandhi quite attractive and... bring the Congress to power in 2019,” he said.
Rawat said the “cooperative federalism” talk could not be seen being implemented in “letter and in spirit” by the NDA government as non-BJP states were struggling to receive central funds.
He referred to Modi’s comment last year that “the Prime Minister and Chief Ministers make Team India” and said, “I want to ask him, if not the captain of Team India, who will feel pain of states? At this moment, the pain of non-BJP states is not being understood. There is no sympathy for these states”.
He wondered what role NITI Aayog, which replaced the Planning Commission, was playing under the Modi dispensation. “Nearly 24 Union ministers are currently visiting poll-bound Uttarakhand but have no development agenda for the people of the state,” Rawat claimed.
“...the Central ministers come to Uttarakhand and ‘praise’ me. But they are not talking about what they will do for Uttarakhand,” he claimed. — PTI

The demonetization after-effect since Nov 8-9 has brought out a contrarian cousin: the Information Technology sector. IT hubs such as Bangalore, Hyderabad and Pune have been largely spared of long queues of people before banks and ATMs. The reason is that most living in these cities have already shifted to a cashless society, the plastic money doing even the small chores. This is a major reflection on how the industry has remained largely unaffected by the government’s exercise to flush out black money.
After the Prime Minister announced the withdrawal of old Rs 500/1000 notes, Nasscom chairman CP Gurnani had said the Indian IT industry stood to gain in a big way. “The IT industry must adapt itself to finding solutions post cashless economy,” he said. The industry deals mostly in bills where most transactions are done digitally. Another major factor which has kept the IT industry insulated is its strong employee base, the youth, who have moved to debit and wallet money. The move will only increase the demand for digital money and lead to more use of plastic and e-wallet money, providing a great boost to companies like PayTM and Citrus.
Satish Kumar V, country head of IT solution company DMX India, said: “We have a highly structured business. This (demonetization) is a good opportunity for the industry as dependence on banking & online transactions, plus communication is set to grow exponentially. This would help players to do smarter business and maintain a transparent record. It is also a boost to the start-up segment.”
E-commerce companies, which initially took a hit will emerge stronger as the country moves towards digitization. Leading consumer internet companies have jointly hailed demonetization. Top executives from Flipkart, Snapdeal, Shopclues, CCAvenues, 1mg Technolgoies, Ola and Oyo Rooms, have welcomed the move saying it will pave the way for digital payments, aid the process of financial inclusion and the overall transformation of the economy.

KULLU, JANUARY 2
Condemning demonetization, former minister and HPCC state vice-president Chander Kumar has accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi of befooling the masses in the name of curbing corruption and black money.
He said that probe should be carried out that how much money was invested in properties and deposited by the BJP and the RSS in their accounts from March 1 to November 8 last. He stated that demonetisation move was rightly mentioned as “organised loot and legalized plunder” by former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. He added that while masses were standing in queues to withdraw limited amounts from banks, the BJP leaders were spending crores in wedding ceremonies of their kin.
He stated that even after the lapse of 50 days of the demonetization move, there was no respite for the masses. The situation had not normalized, as claimed by the Prime Minister and there was economic crisis in the country.
Chander alleged that government had failed to keep the promises made during the polls and various welfare schemes launched by the previous Congress governments were being renamed to claim political mileage. The aftereffects of the demonetization on economy, industry, employment and various other sectors would be analysed and facts would be brought before of the masses.
Ayurveda and Cooperative minister Karan Singh said that the consequences of demonetization would be faced by the BJP in the upcoming Assembly elections in the state.

PM played a master stroke
Narendra Modi played a master stroke by demonetising the Rs 500 and 1,000 notes .Though the move has created numerous problems for people, it is somewhere being believed that it will be a boon in the long run. We all know how the rich people spend crores of rupees on marriages. Now, it is going to be a thing of the past. If anybody wants to spend huge sum on marriages, he will be compelled to spend white money only. It is the most daring and courageous decision of the PM and we should all support it whole-heartedly. I take this opportunity to appreciate the efforts of those volunteers, who are helping the poor and uneducated people standing in queues in filling their forms and also offering them water, tea and biscuits.
Ravinder Kumar Jain, Haibowal Kalan

A bold step
Yes, demonetisation is a bold and right step to curb black /duplicate money. In fact, this step should have been taken several years ago when duplicate notes started being circulated. However, to ensure its better implementation 50 days’ time to deposited old notes is too much. Instead, seven days should have been given. An app should have been introduced for this. Besides, illiterate customers may give their undertaking physically in banks. Other modern means of communications may also be utilised. To avoid rush at bank counters, the bank  concerned after 7-day period should give appointment to customers on telephone for depositing already declared old notes. Preference should have given to senior citizens, BPL card holders, ex-servicemen, families having marriage/ functions, death cases, tourists farmers etc. for depositing/ withdrawal of money in/from their accounts. Replacement of old notes with new currency should not be allowed as it has become a source of misuse. There is wide gap between Rs 100 and Rs 2,000 notes so new currency in Rs 250 /750/1,250 notes of the same size may be helpful. But demonetisation should have been declared only after sufficient stock of new currency. Calibration of ATM machines at this stage is not appreciable. Services of recently retired people having good health, NGO, etc may be sought by banks/ post offices to control the rush. To curb duplicate notes/black money in future, internet banking should be promoted. There should not be any extra charges for using debit cards. There should not be any cash transactions in schools,  colleges, universities as students can easily use internet banking/ swapping machines. Educated and respected people/ professionals of society such as doctors, advocates, architects, CAs, nursing homes, big traders may be asked to accept only plastic money/ DD. There must be a record of customers/ clients showing detail of fee deposited and a receipt must be issued.
Er KK Verma

Misuse of Jan Dhan accounts making plan less effective
No doubt, demonetization is the right step to curb black money but many people especially the rich are misusing the Jan Dhan accounts, which is making the plan less effective. Rs 3 crore deposited by BJP just a day before demonetisation announcement adds to the doubts of citizens. The government could have ensured its better implementation. The ATMs should be kept sufficiently stocked with lower currency notes. Their refilling capacity should be faster. Many schemes don’t even reach the needy people. So, the government should ensure that the common people don’t suffer from these developing stones.
Pooja Goyal, Class – IX student from Ahmedgarh

Will help in curbing black money
Yes, I think demonetisation is the right step taken by the government. It has solved many problems and will help in curbing black money, as one cannot do away from paying taxes. It is a good step, but it would have been a great step if the government had ordered all payments above Rs 5,000 through cheque or from card. We should do away with cash and do all transactions through cards as done in America and other countries. I think cashless money would have made this step more effective.
Dishant Sethi, Class X student from Ahmedgarh

A step in the right direction
It has been rightly said ‘whatever you can do, or dream you can, begin it. Boldness has genius, power, and magic in it’. It is not the question of whether it was a right or a wrong step. It is the question of taking an initiative. The government has at least taken a step to curb black money. Demonetisation is the first step towards success. Exchange of minimum amount, withdraw of cash only from own account, deposition of limited old currency with valid ID and Pan number are the weapons to fight and win the battle to curb black money.
Bipan Sethi,Ahmedgarh
Pathetic execution
“Demonetisation” the very word is giving shivers to the common and honest man these days, whereas it should have given nightmares only to the corrupt people. It is a bold step taken by a strong PM, but the execution of the decision is pathetic. Every outcome would have been tolerated, but if people are dying in banks just to get their own money then something has really gone terribly wrong. Government is saying that there is no shortage of currency, but we have to return empty-handed when bank employees say that they are out of cash. Government should have made proper planning to avoid such chaos. Enough new currency notes should have been printed and Rs 500 note must have been introduced simultaneously as Rs 2,000 note is hardly of any use for the middle class.
Amarjit Singh

Well-intentioned move, but sans proper planning
People must know that black money holders spend a large amount on everything that leads to increase in demand and this pushes inflation. To keep a tab on the ongoing inflation, demonetisation of currency by the PM was necessary and moreover was a strategic move. Such surprising decisions should be carried out at regular intervals by the government. Demonetisation would prove beneficial to curtail illegal activities such as terrorism funding, gambling, and money laundering. Further, like many other government moves, demonetisation has both merits and demerits, which vary as per one’s perspective or one’s role in the economy. The move initiated by the government is a well-intentioned one, but sans proper planning. A lot of inconvenience has been caused to public. Government must keep a tab on the large scale use of black money.
Ravi Chander Garg, Ludhiana

Lack of preparedness, yet a bold move
The PM's intentions are undoubtedly right but for now, the outcome is chaos and a state of uncertainty throughout the country. Serpentine queues and irate bank customers have become a norm. It could have been planned properly to ensure that people were not too inconvenienced. This hardship could have been avoided if the government had taken appropriate measures before implementing it. Why is the common man being penalised for those hoarding black money? The curbs on withdrawal is leading to inconvenience and resulting in irrational consumer behaviour. India is still considered an 'agrarian economy' since nearly half of the labour force is employed in agriculture. How transactions take place here, how money is stored, and the behavior of spending in this sector should have been looked into. Nonetheless, this is a very courageous and bold move. Millions of people will use banking or electronic payments for the first time, creating long-term benefits for themselves and the economy at large. The government must target all other forms of assets too that are used by people to park black money. Demonetisation along with the implementation of GST will certainly help in controlling the 'creation of black money' to a certain extent.
Akash Kumar, Jagraon

It's harassing common manWorst mistake of the govt
Demonetisation was supposed to curb corrupt elements, who have huge reservoirs of black money. But there seems to be less impact on them. Instead, it's the common man who is suffering. We cannot see any politician, rich industrialist, high profile businessman or official standing in queues. And what about people like Vijay Mallya? Black money is outside our country in Swiss banks. Why a common man is being punished for deeds of some corrupt elements in our country?
The Supreme Court has rightly said that the situation can lead to riots. The common man is facing hardships as they have no money to buy their basic necessities. Their business is the worst hit and they are facing financial crisis despite having enough money in bank accounts. Men, women and senior citizens could be seen standing in long queues outside banks and ATMs. The cash supply is limited and long hours of wait cannot provide relief to them. The life of common man has been brought to a halt as their scrapped currency is not being accepted at bus stands, railway stations, petrol pumps, hospitals and almost everywhere. There are incidents of death of senior citizens in queues and patients in hospitals due to this move. There is lack of transparency in system. The leaders and politicians are busy in blame game and political drama who cannot understand the woes of common man struggling to make his both ends meet.  Demonetisation is the worst mistake of the government and the common man is paying a price for it. It is a bad initiative and the way it is being implemented is worse. It is a blow to the common man, economy and the entire nation.

Decision will take time to yield results
Kudos to PM Modi for the ‘surgical strike’ on black money. He has broken the 'back of black money' by banning high-denomination currency notes. The move towards demonetisation does, undoubtedly, have some merits, but should the government not have put the necessary infrastructure in place to handle the fallout of this move, impacting those who don’t trade in or hoard black money? Is the need for secrecy enough to explain the evident lack of preparedness? The worst-affected are people in rural areas and villages where cash is king and the banking system’s penetration is poor. Apart from that, it could have begun printing the new notes in lower denominations a few months in advance without compromising on secrecy. Only time will tell whether Modi's historic move will indeed achieve its desired objectives. But for now, his big challenge is to replenish the cash-gap in the economy as soon as possible, before it deepens the pain. Yet all this short-term pain will be worth it if the move deals a 'body blow' to counterfeit notes, throttles terror funding, and brings all black money out of hiding. This decision is in favour of the nation. It will take time to yield results.
Nikhil Chopra, Jagraon

Move has adversely affected the poor
The ongoing drive to curb black money has adversely affected the lower sections of the society. Poor people are the worst-affected. While people who had accumulated black money are easily converting their black money into white, people standing in queues are wondering if they have done something wrong. It seems the government has failed in providing sufficient cash to people in need. It has failed to provide relief to the sufferings of the poor. Effort on large scale with full conviction is required to successfully complete this task.

People’s support needed for successful implementation
Indian government took a striking step against black money. The step was taken to stop old currency notes used for funding terrorists and to reduce corruption. Its better execution can be done by refilling ATMs and banks properly. This step is dreadful for black money holders. Overall it is a distinct move and initially people will suffer, but it would be better for the future of India. Support of people is needed to implement it successfully.
Kajal Kaushal

Step affected honest people more
Demonetisation initially seemed a salubrious move to limit black money. But in a country like India, with hoarders having their money stored in Swiss bank accounts and given away with gold and real estate, it seems the step affected people with honest, white money more than curbing black money. A good implementation could have been ensured if the government had not allowed the so-called 'influential' people 'influence' banks to exchange their currency as a priority against honest people standing in long queues. The government should have considered the condition of the unorganised sector as well. The best implementation could have been ensured had the government been watchful of the real big fat cats and their activities.
Mannat Bhargav

Poor implementation only drawback
The move was a good way of curbing black money. Just like a parent who is under pressure to grow his single child, the PM, too, has to think about the entire nation. The only drawback was that the plan wasn't sketched out well.
Gursimar Kaur Middha, Ludhiana

Hastily executed decision
Demonetisation is the most potent weapon to unearth black money. The decision of the PM is daring and commendable. But the policy for its implementation, which has created panic and frustration for every citizen, was roughly planned and hastily executed. The required quantity of currency should have been readily available with the RBI. The limit to withdraw money should have been Rs31,000 per month preferably in a pack containing Rs 500*40 + Rs 100*100 + Rs 10*100
KK Sharma, Khanna

Not a right step in curbing black money
It wasn’t demonetisation, but just exchange of notes. It is not a right step in curbing black money because the source of black money can't be eliminated like this. It entirely affected the people who are standing in long queues outside banks. Rather, it resulted in economic slowdown in the fourth quarter. The current situation shows that the government’s preparations are not up to the mark. Its better implementation can be ensured through people's patience and promoting credit facilities.
Tushar Bhandari

Bankers hard-pressed
The demonetisation move of the Modi government has tested the patience of bankers. Be it loaning under 20 point economic program of Indira Gandhi government, financial inclusion or opening of Jan Dhan accounts of the poorest of poor, bankers have always performed to every call of the nation. It is sad that the government has failed in providing adequate infrastructure to bankers in terms of police protection for crowd management and also for adequate security for staff and cash of branches. Bankers are neglecting their families to work late hours almost daily. The staff has not been able to cross-check documents for withdrawal of cash or exchange of cash properly. The government must deploy adequate security with banks for their safety and for the safety of customers’ money.
Brij Goyal, A retired banker

Financial emergency like situation in country
The decision would prove beneficial only if further generation of black-money and corruption is curbed. The government should have banned the operation of bank-lockers from November 8 itself to avoid any manipulation. ATMs should have been operational from day one. The directions issued by the Union Government, RBI and CBDT are being violated which should be followed in letter and spirit. The demonetised currency is not being accepted at toll barriers etc. Law-enforcing agencies should ensure the compliance of recent guidelines and violators should be brought to book with stern action. Banks are not following RBI guidelines. Nursing homes, doctors and chemist shops should accept demonetised notes and the cash received by them should be accepted in banks on a priority and adequate withdrawal should be permitted. Scarcity of currency has brought a financial emergency-like situation. The move has been introduced without proper home work.  All tolls, entry fee, parking fee should be abolished and contractors be compensated. Since a huge amount is to be incurred in implementation of the scheme, the government should bear these petty losses as well. The limit of 2,500 for ATM and present withdrawal limit from account should also be increased. In case of any concealment or illegality, action should be taken afterwards as per law.
SK Mittal, Khanna

The poor and middle class at the receiving end
A decision taken without anticipating or considering its implications and fallouts reflect the capability of the decision-taking authority. Here, a decision has been taken in the good interest of the nation, but it seems more like an exercise to boost an individual or party image. It is just like filling potholes rather than redoing or re-laying the entire road. The poor and middle class people were at the receiving end this time. The government created a tsunami without putting in place the protective measures.
Dr SK Bali

Decision shocking, but necessary
Undoubtedly, the sudden announcement has shocked everyone. But this was necessary to eradicate corruption. Demonetisation is a right step, but many people had to suffer. The decision was not at all easy for people to accept. Change will happen, but with some difficulties and people should support it and be a part of this change for a corruption-free India.
Deepali,Ludhiana
Demonetisation will surely curb black money in India as many other
countries in the world have reaped the advantage. The general public is surely hard-pressed in getting new currency. For better implementation, the government should have arranged printing of new currency
notes well in advance to avoid hardship to the public including senior citizens, farmers and those needing money for wedding etc. In view of scarcity of new currency, the government action seems to be in haste only, though countrymen are appreciating the step. The step will help in curbing black money, but strong steps would also be needed to curb black money of Indians lying abroad.
Dr G Dev, Kitchlu Nagar

Comment | Minna Zutshi 
Decision has been tough for people
Post demonetisation, it has been tough for people. Long queues outside cashless banks, ATMs running dry - life was thrown out of gear, at least for the first week. On the 19th day into demonetisation, normalcy is yet to return. Weddings have been postponed. Small businesses have reported big losses. Traders are feeling the heat. And many banks are still deficit of cash. 
The demonetisation move made new heroes - bankers working overtime, without any break, to keep dispensing cash to the public. It also brought out the worst in the people. In many banks, senior citizens received a raw deal. Angry customers, who had to return, repeatedly, without cash from the banks, vented out their fury on the hapless bank employees. In Ludhiana, a city flush with money, allegations that some banks favoured the influential, by dispensing cash to the latter while denying it to others, flew thick and fast. 
Unscrupulous elements are learnt to have made quick bucks by buying the defunct currency at a 'discounted price'. Some sellers of consumer durables got their share of (illegal) profit through shady transactions. Gold sales peaked in the initial days. 
Scrapping of the Rs 1,000 and Rs 500 currency notes, around 86 per cent of the currency in India, also had a hilarious note to it. Households that would 'normally' be penny pinching suddenly had a generous flow of extra cash for spending lavishly on the monthly grocery (of course, at select departmental stores that accepted the scrapped currency). Water and sewerage bills got paid in advance, as the government had allowed the use of the scrapped currency to pay public utility bills. Suddenly, the domestic helps and drivers became important members of family - their id proofs, aadhaar cards remained much in demand!

Perturbed over huge shortage of currency, bank unions affiliated to All India Bank Employees Association (AIBEA) and All India Bank officers Associations (AIBOA) will hold demonstration here on December 14. However, bank unions confirmed that normal work will not be disrupted. Except SBI, all other banks will join the agitation.
The union has demanded that the RBI should take steps to supply adequate cash to all banks and details of notes supplied to banks should be announced publicly by RBI on a daily basis. The unions also demanded that if RBI is not able to supply adequate cash to banks, then decision should be taken to suspend cash transactions in the bank branches till sufficient cash is supplied.
In a letter to bank unions, the AIBEA and the AIBOA said, for the past one month, employees and officers in the banks had been undergoing extraordinary pressure of work and stress for implementing the demonetization.
“When everyone was expecting that things would improve and there would be respite, new problems have arisen and employees and officers continue to face the wrath of the customers and public. Even though RBI is making statements that enough cash is being supplied to banks, in reality we all know that there is an acute shortage of cash supply to banks from RBI,” CH Venkatachalam, general secretaery, AIBEA wrote in a letter to member unions.

Chandigarh, November 16
Gurdev Singh Babbal, a resident of Majatari village of Mohali district, who owns 17 acres of land, is still levelling his fields to start the sowing of wheat in the coming days.
He rues the Centre’s demonitisation move had delayed his wheat-sowing operations by 7-10 days. Babbal said it took him four days to purchase wheat seed from market as dealers were not accepting old currency and he couldn’t arrange new notes.
Kulwinder Singh of Pamore village in Fatehgarh Sahib district had planned to sow wheat in 12 acres this season. However, even as half of November has passed, Kulwinder has sown wheat in just two acres.
Besides, his major trouble is the renewal of his crop loan limit in village cooperative society and society managers are not accepting old currency notes due to which he is unable to renew his crop loan limit.
“I have to pay Rs 9 lakh to renew my crop loan limit. But, the society is not accepting old currency notes. Now I can’t get my loan renewed. I can’t draw money against the crop loan limit, which I required to purchase inputs for wheat crop. Moreover, I have to  fetch diesel for my tractor from a petrol pump located 5 km away as the nearby petrol pump owner is refusing to accept old currency notes,” he said.
Cases of Gurdev and Kulwinder are not isolated. The demonetisation of notes coupled with limited circulation of currency has hit sowing of wheat in the state. The crop is yet to be sown in 25 per cent of the total area that the state has targeted to bring under wheat cultivation this year.
Agriculture experts said ideally, wheat sowing in the state should be complete by mid of November. However, out of the total 35 lakh hectares that is expected to come under wheat cultivation during this crop season, the crop has been sown over 25.25 lakh hectares only.
The delay in sowing has even caught the attention of the state government. It has sought inputs from Agriculture Department on the delay in sowing and whether demonetization had affected the process.
Agriculture experts say the delay in sowing can decrease wheat productivity by one quintal per acre.

Shimla,  January 2 
Himachal Pradesh Congress Committee (HPCC) president Sukhwinder Singh Sukhu today questioned the alleged land purchases that the BJP was in the process of making for constructing its party offices in Shimla, Solan and Bilaspur in the backdrop of the demonetization move by the Modi regime.
Addressing a press conference here today Sukhu said the BJP must come clean on these alleged land purchases it was planning to make, especially when there are doubts in the mind of the public. “I would like to know as to why the BJP is making these land purchases at an estimated price of about 10 crore (two bighas) at Tuti Kandi in Shimla and about Rs 3 crore land at Bilaspur when the party already has its offices in both these towns,” he quipped. He alleged that the BJP had entered into an agreement to buy land worth Rs 1.50 crore in Solan.
“We are in the process of gathering more information about the possible land purchases that the BJP has made or is in the process of making,” he remarked. He said speculation was already there about the BJP having invested huge amounts in land and property purchases all over the country and the party’s land deals in Himachal was only substantiating these apprehensions.
The Congress chief demanded that the BJP-led Modi regime must disclose the names of all those persons who had deposited amounts above Rs 25 lakh in their banks before November 8 when the Prime Minister announced the demonetization scheme. “A total of over 3 lakh crores has been deposited in various banks before November 8. Our demand is that the Centre must disclose the names of all those who have made huge deposits,” he demanded.
Sukhu said the Opposition parties, including the Congress, had been very patient in giving the Prime Minister the 50 days he had asked for but there seems to be no end to the woes of the people. “The Modi regime has denied the people the right to use their own hard-earned money and it is for this purpose that 115 people had lost their lives,” he remarked. 
The Congress had welcomed and supported the demonetization scheme but the PM must answer the questions raised by AICC general secretary Rahul Gandhi regarding Modi’s name figuring in the Birla diaries and money given by the Sahara group, he said.
The Congress president also questioned BJP’s rhetoric against corruption. “The BJP regime at the Centre has brought in 36 Ordinances but we fail to understand their failure in appointing a Lokpal, which they can do by making an amendment in the absence of Leader of Opposition,” he said. He said it was Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi who had started the fight against corruption by enacting the Prevention of Corruption Act in 1988.

Russia has strongly protested with India on cash shortage affecting the working of its Mission after demonetisation, and wants a quick resolution of the issue, failing which it may explore other options, including summoning Indian diplomat in Moscow.
(Follow The Tribune on Facebook; and Twitter @thetribunechd)
In a letter, Russian Ambassador Alaxander Kadakin has raised the issue of diplomats not being able to withdraw enough money hampering the normal functioning of the mission and sought intervention of the External Affairs Ministry so that the withdrawal restrictions for diplomatic staff are lifted.
"We are awaiting a reply from the MEA and hope that this is resolved quickly. Otherwise, we will be forced to explore other options which may include raising the issue in Moscow with your Embassy by summoning Indian Minister Counsellor," a senior Russian embassy official said here.
Other options may also include restriction on the cash withdrawals for Indian diplomats posted in Russia, the official indicated.
There are approximately 200 staffers in Russian mission here.
There was no immediate reaction from the Indian side on the complaint.
Earlier, the Dean of Diplomatic Corps had also raised the issue, complaining about the problems faced by the missions.
It is also understood that some other countries like Ukraine and Kazakhstan have also protested to the ministry.
After the demonetization last month, MEA had said it has approached Department of Economic Affairs over three or four types of requests including those related to maintaining sufficient flow of funds to diplomatic missions following the demonetization and was awaiting a decision from it. —PTI

Dismissing apprehensions of a slowdown in revenues post demonetisation, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley today said the direct and indirect tax collection will be higher than the Budget estimates.
He said with a gap of one quarter and the integration of the informal economy with the formal economy, all revenues, including revenue of the states, are likely to go up.
Responding to demands by some states of a higher compensation under the Goods and Services Tax (GST) due to the effect of demonetization, the Finance Minister said “states that are governed well have earned well”. 
Jaitley was referring to the West Bengal Finance Minister Amit Mitra demanding more compensation saying there is a drop in tax revenue post- demonetisation.
He said the government has asked the states to give month-wise tax revenue data to see demonetisation impact on their revenues.
On the issue of RBI directives on note exchange post the December 30 deadline, he ruled out interfering with the conditions barring anyone other than NRIs and Indians returning from abroad from depositing the old notes in RBI branches.
When asked that the Prime Minister in his November 8 address to the nation had also said that people will have opportunity till March 31 to deposit old notes in select RBI branches, Jaitley said the Prime Minister had specifically said that RBI will fix terms and conditions. "The word terms and conditions was part of Prime Minister's address," he said.

Though the Goods and Service Tax (GST) enrolment for the existing VAT dealers was supposed to be over by December 31, it is keeping many businessmen and traders on tenterhooks as they have not yet received the user IDs and the password necessary for the online GST registration. 
However, the Goods and Service Tax enrollment has begun for service tax,
The sluggishness of the Goods and Service Tax  website for registration on the last three days of the deadline has increased the skepticism of industrialists regarding government’s preparedness for the GST. 
After the set setback to industry due to demonetisation, industrialists fear that the unpreparedness of the government regarding the rollout of the Goods and Service Tax  is going to put the industry in trouble. 
Badish Jindal, president, Federation of Punjab Small Industries Association, said the government was rushing for rolling out the Goods and Service Tax , but the basic infrastructure for it seemed to be missing. 
He said, “The GST will function completely online. How is it supposed to work for the country 80 per cent of which has poor internet connectivity? It is going to be difficult for the small scale industry which will have to incur additional expenditure for hiring financial experts, employees, etc.” 
“If the government pushes the roll out of the GST by April, it is going to be another blunder after unplanned demonetisation,” Jindal said. 
GS Kahlon, president, Auto Parts Manufacturers’ Association, said the industry was already facing problems after demonetization. He said the government should roll out the Goods and Service Tax only after it was completely prepared, so that the industry did not face any hassles.

It’s true that every change needs some time and hardships have to be faced in its course of establishment, but it is the common man who has to bear the brunt. Standing in long queues has become a part of his daily chores, and that too for long durations. Bigwigs are not seen waiting for their turn to exchange or deposit money. The government should have provided ample new currency to the banks.
Rashi Srivastava, Chandigarh
Abrupt decision
The arrangements made by the government for exchange and deposit of defunct currency of Rs 1,000 and Rs 500 are appreciable and hi-tech. As the decision was announced abruptly to flush out black money from the system it created unnecessary panic among the people. The configuration and activation of ATMs should be done on priority basis in the rural areas so that pressure on nearby cities can be considerably lessened.
Bhupinder S Sealopal, Mohali
Good decision but badly timed
Demonetisation of currency is a good step to check black money but ill-timed and badly managed. Announcing the measure just before the assembly elections was not the right thing, something that has not gone down well with the opposition parties. Moreover, how will this move bring back black money stashed abroad? The money already deposited with foreign banks must have changed into currency of that country. People are being put to difficulties. The common man’s money has been lost.
Bharat Bhushan Sharma
Country halts in its tracks
The tentacles of black money struck such deep roots in Indian society that it became necessary for a surgical operation to checkmate its growth. Notwithstanding the positive effects, especially a blow to the counterfeit currency used to support  terrorism, drug mafia, the builders and so on, the demonetisation of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 currency has brought the country to a grinding halt.
SS Arora, Mohali
Loss worth crores suffered
Government action to stop the circulation of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 brought about a moderate intensity earthquake in the whole of India on the night of November 8, giving a jolt to both the rich and the poor, resulting in chaos. The nation, it appears, was on strike for two days and suffered loss worth crores due to the shutting down of all types of business and activities carried out by the rich and the poor.
AS Ahuja, Chandigarh
Poor flow of new currency
The bold action taken by the Modi Government to unearth black money, check corruption and fake currency, is a brilliant move. The only thing that needs to be done now is to make it a success. During the first ten days, there have been long queues in front of banks and ATMs, and people are still facing hardships. This is mainly due to the poor flow of new currency to the banks and the ATMs.
Colonel RD Singh (retd), Ambala Cantt
Dedicated cash vans for ATMs needed
Demonetisation of high-value notes is a welcome operation against black money, corruption and financiers of terrorists that helps in neutralising parallel economy.   However, the banks were not prepared for its execution with most ATMs running dry. To ease the problem of the common man, the government should have ensured sufficient cash in ATMs for 24 hours. To refill the ATMs, dedicated cash vans with police protection should have been arranged for.
Col Balbir Singh Mathauda (Retd)
Bold move by govt
Chanakya had said that demonetisation is a necessary evil that the government should undertake from time to time to check black money. The government has made a courageous move to check black money and bring it back into national economy besides hitting the funding of terrorism besides anti-national and anti-social activities. It is obvious from the new rules being implemented to minimise the problems.
Rakesh Chaudhry, Ambala Cantt
Poor planning
The demonetization of higher denomination currency notes is a step towards making the country free from corruption and black money. The bold and historic step by the government needs to be appreciated. But the poor planning for its implementation is causing discontentment and chaos among the poor. The most affected are those who are religiously paying their tax. The availability of new and small denomination notes must have been ensured.
Wg Cdr Jasbir Singh Minhas (retd), Mohali
Recalibrate the ATMs with Rs 100 notes
There is no denying the fact that the dust raised by demonetisation is gradually settling down. The banks did a commendable job by extending their working hours. The need of the hour is to recalibrate the ATMs primarily with Rs 100 notes as these are used by the common man. An ATM is an off-shoot of a bank account. People can enter the banks as well during working hours to withdraw money to ease the pressure on ATMs.
Nikita Kapur, Chandigarh
Hire retired bank staff
The demonetisation of Rs 500/Rs1,000 notes and permitting the public a 50-day window to deposit/exchange these in banks is a welcome step. It is aimed at cleansing the system. The RBI should direct the banks to recalibrate the ATMs to avoid inconvenience faced by the common man. Banks may hire the services of their retired employees for speedy currency swap. One can hope that the current chaos is resolved earlier than later.
Harish Kapur, Chandigarh
Mobile cash vans, token system needed
It is perhaps the most significant move to flush out black money. This also caused some hardships to the common man. Yet, despite the inconvenience, the public has been largely supportive. This decision could perhaps have been executed in a more refined manner to ensure less problems.  I have some suggestions to ease these problems. Cash flow should be normalised. Mobile cash vans for remote areas and the token system should be introduced.
Vidya Sagar Garg, Panchkula
Oppn has hijacked the issue
The government’s move to ban Rs 500 and R 1,000 currency notes was good till it was hijacked by notorious black-marketers and the Opposition parties, who just oppose the government’s move. There is no harassment to the citizens as the system already has reasonable financial provisions. Corruption, however, is rampant as dubious middle men have got the novel opportunity of exploiting the public. Non-acceptance of Rs 2,000 notes by the traders and shopkeepers, so far, is a problem.
MPS Chadha, Mohali
A bold decision
First of all, I congratulate the Prime Minister for taking this bold decision to eradicate corruption and black money. The whole country is with him. On the other hand, our management of the RBI and the Finance Department did not take into account the hardships that a common man will suffer. It would have been better if before announcing demonetization, sufficient new currency had been made available.
Tarlok Singh, Mani Majra
Don’t succumb to pressure
Although the random decision of demonetising the currency has made the common man suffer, yet benefits seem to be in store. The Prime Minister`s assurance of taking more stern steps in the near future has strengthened the will of the general public. Therefore, the government should not bow before any pressure to halt the reforms.
Surinder Paul Wadhwa, Mohali
Lower strata of society affected
The demonetisation of currency notes of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 is timely. It will definitely eradicate corruption, black money and fake currency notes. The lower middle class and the lower income groups are facing problems because most of them do not have high-value notes and live on daily earnings. The small value notes are not available with the general public, leading to great difficulty.
RK Kapoor, Chandigarh
PM deserves kudos
The surprise announcement by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on November 8 was no less than a surgical strike on the country’s black money hoarders and for this, he deserves to be
congratulated, especially because the announcement caught several hoarders napping. But the government functionaries were also simultaneously caught unawares and the move exposed the irresponsible and utterly reckless attitude towards the ground realities.
Group Captain (retd) Samaresh Kumar Goswami, Panchkula
A masterstroke
The surprise announcement by the PM was definitely a master stroke and he definitely succeeded in inflicting an unexpected blow on the internal economy to flush out black money from the coffers of the hoarders, who had no option but to accept the announcement, forcing them to run helter-skelter from the jewellery shops to foreign exchange dealers or to the real estate dealers to convert their black money into white.
Raj Kumari, Panchkula
Common man frustrated
The Prime Minister’s bombshell dropped on the night of November 8 made the  man on  the  road run  for  cover. The  news of  banks  being closed the next day  and  the  ATMs for  two days,  added  to  the discomfiture  of all those  who  did not  have smaller  currency  for  two days to purchase the essentials  of  daily  need. Frustration due to denial of own money and anxiety drove everyone  to  the banks  and  ATMs.
SC Luthra, Mani Majra
Charity has begun at home
I welcome the move by our Prime Minister to flush out black money. The inconvenience being caused is temporary and that too for a short time but in the long run, people will feel good. It is true that the Prime Minister promised during his election campaign to bring back black money from abroad but as the popular saying goes, “Charity begins at home”.
Ujagar Singh, Chandigarh
Weddings affected
A lot of inconvenience is being experienced by the people who have fixed the marriages of their children these days, as expenses, both planned and unforeseen, are involved. Imagine the plight of a person whose ward’s marriage is fixed. He must have lakhs of rupees in cash handy to meet the expenses involved. No measures or guidelines have been laid for this exigency.

New Delhi, November 14
The Delhi Assembly has called an emergency session tomorrow to discuss the "explosive" situation arising out of demonetisation, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal announced today even as he attacked Prime Minister Narendra Modi for his 'kadak chai' remark saying the poor were being "fed poison" instead.
Kejriwal said considering the hardship being faced by people, the Delhi Government has decided to deploy four thousands civil defence volunteers who will provide citizens queuing up outside banks and ATMs with water and refreshments, while also assisting them with paper work.
Reiterating his demand that demonetisation be rolled back, the AAP chief lashed out at Modi, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, saying the Centre has lost "all sense of proportion due to lack of any concrete plan in executing the scheme." 
"The situation is just the opposite of what the Prime Minister said. The poor are not sleeping. They are spending nights outside banks. Only Modiji's friends are having good sleep. He has made the poor drink poison in the name of strong tea 'kadak chai'," Kejriwal said.
The Chief Minister said he was pained to see people struggle for cash to buy the basic necessities like food items and medicines, adding the government was exploring options to arrange cooked food for those in need.
"We have also asked the Divisional Commissioner to explore in the next two to three days the possibility of arranging food through 'langars' for those who are having to starve due to lack of hard cash," Kejriwal said.
The Health Secretary has also been directed to ensure that there is no shortage in city government-run hospitals, Kejriwal said. The Cabinet meet was attended by the ministers and top officials, including the Chief Secretary.
He is likely to meet his Bengal counterpart Mamata Banerjee, who has also been vociferously opposing the measure, when she arrives in New Delhi tomorrow.
"It is simply a mechanism to transfer 50 per cent of the country's total black money to BJP's accounts. The intention is UP polls. They would have arrested swiss bank account holders and manufacturers of counterfeit currency had they wanted to act against black economy," he said.

Dealing with the demonetization drive, aimed at sifting the black from the white, the bee came back from the ATM with fifty shades of pink on Rs 2,000 note. “I am still looking for ‘change’,” it said at the Buzz Stop, when the conductor bee asked our information monger for the buzz fare. “Who says the best things in the world are for free,” shouts our bee as it struggled to make it back to the hive. Now, apart from Bee Gees and Beetles, this one is also a huge fan of Bollywood singer Shanker Mahadevan who live streamed the launch of the song titled ‘Garv Se Jiyenge’ on Facebook and it has gone viral. The song has been composed for an ongoing campaign called “Garv Se” launched by Enable India, an NGO that aims to empower the differently-abled, in collaboration with the Accessible India Campaign under the Department of Empowerment of Persons with Disability, Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment.
Bee likes the idea of both, singing and stinging; so as it brings us some interesting memes of Fidel Castro that went viral after his death on Saturday, it also fills us with interesting news from around the world that has been topping internet’s viral brigade with layers of extra cream and cheese... oh! And honey too.
Face the book
In India, the long queues at ATMs have become a platform for exercising the right to freedom of speech and expression. Darshan Dhillon, who served in the Army for 20 years, was recently subjected to a casual-political debate open to all. His outburst on Facebook had the bee giving him an “I feel you” salute.
“I was standing in long ATM Q and getting irritated on mismanagement on a good issue. The fellow Modi bhakt behind gave me a quick reaction by saying, why are you perturbed think about Army persons standing 20 hrs in a day on border. My curt reply removed his deshbhagti with a jolt when I told him that I did that on border for 20 years and standing here to withdraw my pension on that account. He should show his deshbhagti in getting us actual OROP and CPC from Modi ji rather than issuing certificates in ATM lines.
Fauji Baba”. The post has gone viral on Internet with over 6.6k likes.
She wrote:
“I have a lot to be thankful for this year.. My year has been the hardest yet most rewarding one yet. I’ve finally fought the fight of not ‘being enough’. I have only wanted to reflect the love you guys have given me for years and show how important it is to take care of YOU. By grace through faith. Kindness always wins. I love you guys. God bless”

Beppu has more hot springs than anywhere else in Japan. “It is like the smart city project videos on the government website, just slightly better, perhaps!,” says the bee in an over-analysing tone. Got a bee trap anyone?
Beesidwes, wife of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s chief spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, sparked outrage on social media by performing a Holocaust-themed ice skating routine that also went viral.

Rural Maharashtra is falling back on credit as local co-operative banks and credit societies run out of cash following the demonetization. These bodies are not even touched by public sector banks. 
The Congress and the Nationalist Congress Party, which controls a bulk of co-operative banks in Maharashtra, accuse the government of trying to crush the sector. “The ruling BJP has a political motive to shut down the co-operative banking sector,” says Congress leader Radhakrishna Vikhe-Patil. Chief Minister Fadnavis accuses his opponents of trying to launder their black money via these institutions. “The cash collection at the district co-operative banks was much more than that at nationalized banks. Black money has been deposited at these banks all over the country,” Fadnavis said.
Though the state is credited with a robust co-operative network, it is largely operative in western Maharashtra with the infrastructure fraying into the interiors. At the top is the Maharashtra State Co-operative Bank under which there are 31 district co-op banks. Several small co-operative banks dot Maharashtra landscape with co-operative credit societies making up the last-mile in financial inclusion.
In all they collectively number some 23,000 organizations. The demonetization has forced severe restrictions on these banks. “We are not able to release loans sanctioned by credit societies and co-operative banks,” says Vasant Shinde, executive chairman of Maharashtra State Federation Credit Cooperative Societies. These bodies do not have currency chests and depend on district co-operative banks and public sector banks . Shinde says co-operative bodies are stuck with old currency to the tune of Rs 27,000 crore which are yet to be exchanged.

New Delhi, November 23
Congress vice president Rahul Gandhi, leading the protest against demonetisation in Parliament, on Wednesday said the party wanted a joint parliamentary committee probe into the “scam” involving prior leakage of the decision to a select few in the BJP.
Insisting on opposition unity moments after 12 parties joined hands to lead a protest against the move in Parliament House, the Amethi MP said all leaders also wanted Prime Minister Narendra Modi to come to Parliament, listen to them and tell the nation why he took a decision that “hit the people and economy”.

After the joint opposition protest, Rahul described demonetisation of high-denomination currency as the biggest impromptu financial experiment in the world saying the decision had hit the Indian economy. He also alleged that the Finance Minister or the Chief Economic Adviser did not know of the move, adding that the BJP organisations in Bengal and other places knew of that which explained why bank deposits surged on the eve of the announcement on November 8.
Asked how the BJP organisations could have known of the move when the FM did not, Gandhi said, “BJP organisations knew so did a few industrialist friends of the PM.”
Earlier, the Gandhi scion took swipes at the PM for addressing a pop concert and “naach gaana” saying, “The PM can give lectures to a pop concert where naach gaana is going on. Over 200 MPs are saying they want to tell the nation why he took this decision. The PM does not want to come to Parliament. Why is the PM afraid of going inside Parliament? He is obviously anxious about something.”
Gandhi said there was no division in the opposition camp about demands around demonetization, adding, “First of all we want the PM, who represents the country, to come to Parliament. He should sit in the debate. He will have to listen to us, will have to sit there. Second, we see a scam behind this move. The PM and the BJP president told their own people of the scam. We need a JPC to probe that. You see cent per cent united opposition standing here. Over 200 MPs are here. We are united. The PM should tell us why he has taken this decision.”
Gandhi said all opposition parties were fighting against black money but the question is why one decision should harass one billion people.
“It’s a question of complete centralisation of power. The country cannot be run in this manner. You have hit the economy. The economy was working well, though not as well as in the UPA time. Bengal and Kerala fishermen industry has been finished, small traders have been hit. Have you seen anyone in suit-boot in the queues?” Gandhi said accusing the PM of unilaterally taking the demonetization decision.
Asked who is leading the protest from the opposition side considering BSP chief Mayawati and SP chief Muyalam Singh were not personally part of the opposition protest on Wednesday though their MPs came, Rahul said poor people’s voice is leading this protest and MPs are representing that voice.
He said it was shameful that 70 people had died following the move and Parliament had not made any obituary reference to them.
The Congress remained adamant on its demand for an adjournment motion debate on the issue in Lok Sabha with Rahul saying, “The PM is afraid of allowing an adjournment motion.”
The government says it is ready to debate demonetisation under Rule 193 which does not entail voting unlike an adjournment notice under Rule 56 of the LS procedures.

Experts from northern region stress four factors: funding, scaling, execution and credibility. Sarvjeet Singh Virk, managing director, Finvasia says: “Funding will be the key issue followed by credibility which will peak as there is a fear among vendors as well as investors. Scaling of operation will matter hugely as many top institutes such as IITs and IIMs bar entry of startups in their campuses.” He sees mergers and acquisitions in 2017 also. For instance, Chandigarh-based Finvasia, a company offering services in asset management, investment banking, capital market advisory and currency hedging, has announced that it has closed a funding deal with some of the industry’s notable venture capitalists, where a majority of FDI stake is from Mauritius-based entity of Intrinsic Investments Ltd. 
Kunal Nandwani, founder & CEO, uTrade Solutions, says funding may get worse. A slow-down in economy post demonetization will pose a challenge for startups. He says with the US hiking rates, most fund houses would pull out from India and would invest in that country. “Curbing work visa by the US will also hamper the growth of Indian companies,” he added. 
“Investors are more cautious than ever because of many failed business models in grocery and food delivery segment,” says Arun Kumar, founder, Organo Fresh Solution (P) Ltd. Vineet Khurana, VP Operations, Chandigarh Angels Network (CAN), says the biggest and the foremost challenge would be sustaining a startup. “Me too” businesses would find the going even tougher, he said.
So, what do we do?
Sumeer Walia, director, Chitkara Innovation Centre, says robust mentoring programs are needed. That means looking for ideas as per market needs. “Seed funding comes next. This is essential for innovative and engineering startups ready with prototypes for industry linkage on a perpetual basis. 
Nandwani of uTrade Solutions says promoters have to focus on a sustainable business model and focus on profitability more than mere discounting stuff.
To gear up the challenges, Sumeer says startups are looking at options to outsource their work in countries like the Philippines, Malaysia, China and Taiwan. “You need to build a business that is unique and operationally profitable. Startups should work on building efficient processes to reduce their operational cost and also build a service that people need,” says Arun Kumar.

It’s true that every change needs some time and hardships have to be faced in its course of establishment, but it is the common man who has to bear the brunt. Standing in long queues has become a part of his daily chores, and that too for long durations. Bigwigs are not seen waiting for their turn to exchange or deposit money. The government should have provided ample new currency to the banks.
Rashi Srivastava, Chandigarh
Abrupt decision
The arrangements made by the government for exchange and deposit of defunct currency of Rs 1,000 and Rs 500 are appreciable and hi-tech. As the decision was announced abruptly to flush out black money from the system it created unnecessary panic among the people. The configuration and activation of ATMs should be done on priority basis in the rural areas so that pressure on nearby cities can be considerably lessened.
Bhupinder S Sealopal, Mohali
Good decision but badly timed
Demonetisation of currency is a good step to check black money but ill-timed and badly managed. Announcing the measure just before the assembly elections was not the right thing, something that has not gone down well with the opposition parties. Moreover, how will this move bring back black money stashed abroad? The money already deposited with foreign banks must have changed into currency of that country. People are being put to difficulties. The common man’s money has been lost.
Bharat Bhushan Sharma
Country halts in its tracks
The tentacles of black money struck such deep roots in Indian society that it became necessary for a surgical operation to checkmate its growth. Notwithstanding the positive effects, especially a blow to the counterfeit currency used to support  terrorism, drug mafia, the builders and so on, the demonetisation of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 currency has brought the country to a grinding halt.
SS Arora, Mohali
Loss worth crores suffered
Government action to stop the circulation of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 brought about a moderate intensity earthquake in the whole of India on the night of November 8, giving a jolt to both the rich and the poor, resulting in chaos. The nation, it appears, was on strike for two days and suffered loss worth crores due to the shutting down of all types of business and activities carried out by the rich and the poor.
AS Ahuja, Chandigarh
Poor flow of new currency
The bold action taken by the Modi Government to unearth black money, check corruption and fake currency, is a brilliant move. The only thing that needs to be done now is to make it a success. During the first ten days, there have been long queues in front of banks and ATMs, and people are still facing hardships. This is mainly due to the poor flow of new currency to the banks and the ATMs.
Colonel RD Singh (retd), Ambala Cantt
Dedicated cash vans for ATMs needed
Demonetisation of high-value notes is a welcome operation against black money, corruption and financiers of terrorists that helps in neutralising parallel economy.   However, the banks were not prepared for its execution with most ATMs running dry. To ease the problem of the common man, the government should have ensured sufficient cash in ATMs for 24 hours. To refill the ATMs, dedicated cash vans with police protection should have been arranged for.
Col Balbir Singh Mathauda (Retd)
Bold move by govt
Chanakya had said that demonetisation is a necessary evil that the government should undertake from time to time to check black money. The government has made a courageous move to check black money and bring it back into national economy besides hitting the funding of terrorism besides anti-national and anti-social activities. It is obvious from the new rules being implemented to minimise the problems.
Rakesh Chaudhry, Ambala Cantt
Poor planning
The demonetization of higher denomination currency notes is a step towards making the country free from corruption and black money. The bold and historic step by the government needs to be appreciated. But the poor planning for its implementation is causing discontentment and chaos among the poor. The most affected are those who are religiously paying their tax. The availability of new and small denomination notes must have been ensured.
Wg Cdr Jasbir Singh Minhas (retd), Mohali
Recalibrate the ATMs with Rs 100 notes
There is no denying the fact that the dust raised by demonetisation is gradually settling down. The banks did a commendable job by extending their working hours. The need of the hour is to recalibrate the ATMs primarily with Rs 100 notes as these are used by the common man. An ATM is an off-shoot of a bank account. People can enter the banks as well during working hours to withdraw money to ease the pressure on ATMs.
Nikita Kapur, Chandigarh
Hire retired bank staff
The demonetisation of Rs 500/Rs1,000 notes and permitting the public a 50-day window to deposit/exchange these in banks is a welcome step. It is aimed at cleansing the system. The RBI should direct the banks to recalibrate the ATMs to avoid inconvenience faced by the common man. Banks may hire the services of their retired employees for speedy currency swap. One can hope that the current chaos is resolved earlier than later.
Harish Kapur, Chandigarh
Mobile cash vans, token system needed
It is perhaps the most significant move to flush out black money. This also caused some hardships to the common man. Yet, despite the inconvenience, the public has been largely supportive. This decision could perhaps have been executed in a more refined manner to ensure less problems.  I have some suggestions to ease these problems. Cash flow should be normalised. Mobile cash vans for remote areas and the token system should be introduced.
Vidya Sagar Garg, Panchkula
Oppn has hijacked the issue
The government’s move to ban Rs 500 and R 1,000 currency notes was good till it was hijacked by notorious black-marketers and the Opposition parties, who just oppose the government’s move. There is no harassment to the citizens as the system already has reasonable financial provisions. Corruption, however, is rampant as dubious middle men have got the novel opportunity of exploiting the public. Non-acceptance of Rs 2,000 notes by the traders and shopkeepers, so far, is a problem.
MPS Chadha, Mohali
A bold decision
First of all, I congratulate the Prime Minister for taking this bold decision to eradicate corruption and black money. The whole country is with him. On the other hand, our management of the RBI and the Finance Department did not take into account the hardships that a common man will suffer. It would have been better if before announcing demonetization, sufficient new currency had been made available.
Tarlok Singh, Mani Majra
Don’t succumb to pressure
Although the random decision of demonetising the currency has made the common man suffer, yet benefits seem to be in store. The Prime Minister`s assurance of taking more stern steps in the near future has strengthened the will of the general public. Therefore, the government should not bow before any pressure to halt the reforms.
Surinder Paul Wadhwa, Mohali
Lower strata of society affected
The demonetisation of currency notes of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 is timely. It will definitely eradicate corruption, black money and fake currency notes. The lower middle class and the lower income groups are facing problems because most of them do not have high-value notes and live on daily earnings. The small value notes are not available with the general public, leading to great difficulty.
RK Kapoor, Chandigarh
PM deserves kudos
The surprise announcement by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on November 8 was no less than a surgical strike on the country’s black money hoarders and for this, he deserves to be
congratulated, especially because the announcement caught several hoarders napping. But the government functionaries were also simultaneously caught unawares and the move exposed the irresponsible and utterly reckless attitude towards the ground realities.
Group Captain (retd) Samaresh Kumar Goswami, Panchkula
A masterstroke
The surprise announcement by the PM was definitely a master stroke and he definitely succeeded in inflicting an unexpected blow on the internal economy to flush out black money from the coffers of the hoarders, who had no option but to accept the announcement, forcing them to run helter-skelter from the jewellery shops to foreign exchange dealers or to the real estate dealers to convert their black money into white.
Raj Kumari, Panchkula
Common man frustrated
The Prime Minister’s bombshell dropped on the night of November 8 made the  man on  the  road run  for  cover. The  news of  banks  being closed the next day  and  the  ATMs for  two days,  added  to  the discomfiture  of all those  who  did not  have smaller  currency  for  two days to purchase the essentials  of  daily  need. Frustration due to denial of own money and anxiety drove everyone  to  the banks  and  ATMs.
SC Luthra, Mani Majra
Charity has begun at home
I welcome the move by our Prime Minister to flush out black money. The inconvenience being caused is temporary and that too for a short time but in the long run, people will feel good. It is true that the Prime Minister promised during his election campaign to bring back black money from abroad but as the popular saying goes, “Charity begins at home”.
Ujagar Singh, Chandigarh
Weddings affected
A lot of inconvenience is being experienced by the people who have fixed the marriages of their children these days, as expenses, both planned and unforeseen, are involved. Imagine the plight of a person whose ward’s marriage is fixed. He must have lakhs of rupees in cash handy to meet the expenses involved. No measures or guidelines have been laid for this exigency.

The BJP will soon initiate a “chargesheet pe charcha” on the issues figuring in the charge sheet prepared by the party against the state government’s acts of commission and omission in its four-year rule.
Such discussions will be held at various levels, including the mandal and booth levels, to educate the masses about the various acts of corruption involving the state government. As many as 40,000 copies of the charge sheet will also be published in the party’s monthly magazine and distributed widely.
This decision was taken at the state BJP’s two-day executive meeting which began at Baddi today. It was also decided to compile district and mandal-level charge sheets enlisting the corruption prevailing at the local levels within a time-bound manner.
A decision to hold Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s rally in Himachal after the polls in five Vidhan Sabha state was also taken.
Addressing party leaders, Shrikant Sharma, BJP’s state in-charge and national Secretary, said it was time to rid Himachal of the Congress which had provided the most corrupt government in the country and belied the hopes of the people.
He urged the party activists to gear up for this mission.  The Congress and other opposition parties were opposing demonetization tooth and nail. He said the Congress was trying to mislead the masses on this issue.
Lauding the two-and-a-half year stint of Prime Minister Narendra Modi he said his progressive policies had helped improve the country’s image globally and Pakistan has been isolated internationally. He enlisted scams of the UPA government and said Modi, on the contrary, had given a corruption-free government where as many as 197 public welfare schemes had been launched.
He said the recent civic polls held in various states where the BJP had won 8,000 of the 10,000 seats was a referendum on the demonetisation policy which had found support of the masses.
A resolution enlisting the state’s government’s failure on various fronts was also passed in the meeting. BJP’s vice president Randhir Sharma, while presenting the resolution, said Chief Minister Virbhadra Singh had become synonymous with false announcements as barely 300 of the 1,300 announcements made by him had been honoured till now. The government had deceived various sections of the society, including farmers, horticulturists, unemployed youth, labourers, students as well as employees and promises made in the manifesto had remained unfulfilled.
Health and education sectors were bereft of staff and the law and order situation was going from bad to worse while the various mafias were proliferating. He said the failure of the state government to finalize detailed project reports of 61 highways reflected its poor governance and the benefit of several Central schemes failed to be utilized by the state government.
Former CM and Leader of the Opposition PK Dhumal, state president Satpal Satti, MPs Shanta Kumar, Anurag Thakur, Ramswrup Sharma, Virender Kashyap, Organisational Secretary Pawan Rana and other senior leaders were also present on the occasion.

New Delhi, November 20
Drug supply in the city has been stopped after demonetisation. Surprisingly, during the last 10 days not a single supply of drugs consignment or fake currency has come to notice in any part of Delhi and NCR.
The disclosure came from the police special cell and the country’s intelligence agencies through mobile surveillance. The special cell has kept the phones of more than a dozen drugs suppliers on surveillance.
According to a senior crime branch officer, “One will be surprised to know that no small or big drug peddler is getting any consignment due to demonetisation. Earlier, we used to catch hold of drug peddlers every second day, but since last 10 days no drug consignment is been moved or delivered.”
The investigating agencies of the country, including the Delhi Police, are staking claim that the black marketing and drugs business has come to a standstill.
It is to be noted that the special cell of the police last year, had apprehended maximum drugs consignment and its suppliers and drug peddlers.
One of the special cell senior official told The Tribune that the drugs were coming in India from Myanmar border Kalichuk of Manipur, Afganistan, Bangladesh, Malda West Bengal.
“Farming of opium is done in Kalichuk. From these places big quantity of drugs was going to Uttar Pradesh’s Bareilly, Badaun and Barabanki, Mansoor and Jhalawar in Madhya Pradesh, and Chittor in Rajasthan. From these places, the receivers used to supply drugs to Punjab, Delhi and other metropolitan cities of India,” he said.
According to the police special cell official, black marketing business has stopped due to demonetization and drugs demand declined. 
Little respite for city on Sunday: Banks shut, ATMs dry
Shortage of cash continued to trouble people in the national Capital today, the second Sunday post demonetisation, which saw banks shut and ATMs running dry in most places.
In many areas, people, in desperate need of short change, ran from one ATM to the other, with few managing to withdraw and the rest left dejected as machines emptied out before their turn.
At places, queues formed up within minutes of news spreading word of mouth that cash was being dispensed at a particular ATM.
“I went looking for cash at an ATM in Central Delhi. As soon as I entered the details, there was deduction from my account, but the machine did not disburse any cash,” said Jheelum Mitra, an IT professional.
On weekdays, the police have been deploying about 12,000 personnel outside banks and ATMs to manage crowd.
Banks have been serving only their respective customers and are not exchanging the old Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes from customers of other banks since yesterday. — PTI

Nitin Jain
Queuing up has been the order of the day for one and all during the past ten days, since Prime Minister Narendra Modi took the country by surprise by announcing sudden and unexpected demonetization of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 currency notes late in the evening of November 8.
The historic move, as has been billed by the powers-that-be, may be aimed at weeding out black money from the market, as promised by the ruling BJP before the high-stakes 2014 Lok Sabha polls, but the great hardship faced by the aam aadmi in getting the old cash deposited or new cash withdrawn from his bank and post office accounts, has left him in pain and smarting under indignation.
At the outset, the public at large supported the idea behind the demonetization drive, ballyhooed as something in the larger good of the nation, but the harassment they faced outside banks, post offices and ATMs in serpentine queues dampened their spirits, waned their enthusiasm, and conditioned their response. Even the faithful turned circumspect.
Another major problem the common man faced was when he was handed the new Rs 2,000 note, which came into circulation from day one while the new Rs 500 note is yet to make its appearance at most banks. With this new highest denomination note, the commoners felt hard-pressed buying their daily needs with most shopkeepers refusing to accept it as they did not have the change to return the balance amount.
Also hit hard were the bank and post office staffers. Working overtime left them with their backs aching, eyes swollen and heads rolling. The foot soldiers of the Prime Minister’s demonetization brigade had to leave their homes and families unattended to answer the call of duty. It is an open secret that leave of no kind was allowed in banks, and sanctioned leave was cancelled. Their indulgence notwithstanding, erratic and inadequate flow of new currency and improper arrangements led to chaos for cash, and made the bank staff face the fury of irate customers.
Housewives and small vendors, who had saved their hard-earned money, were in for a rude shock when they found junked notes constituting majority of their savings. With housewives standing ‘exposed’ in front of their husbands, they not only had to gorge out their ‘secret’ money holding but explain it too to their husbands.
The demonetisation was ill-timed, coming as it did in the first eight days of the month, when generally sales and purchases at the departmental stores and other shops selling merchandised goods are on the upswing. Pumping in enough new money and making adequate arrangements to ensure that the aam aadmi continues to lead normal life is the need of the hour.   

**************************************************


First the good news from the demonetization front: defaulters of property tax, borrowers who absconded after collecting crores of rupees from banks, miserly businessmen who seldom pay their employees on time and others of their ilk have suddenly become virtuous and opened their pocket books. The newly opened spigot is spewing out enormous amounts of cash. And most of it is in currency notes of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 denominations exited by the government.
“The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation collected Rs 650 crore in property and water taxes in just four days,” the civic body said in a statement. Local bodies across Maharashtra collected another Rs 400 crore in the first week since demonetization. Never mind that the payola consists entirely of the newly contraband currency. “Many people who we have been chasing for years to pay up have come forward with money,” says Rajendra Nimbhalkar, Municipal Commissioner of the Ulhasnagar Municipal Corporation.
The small township collected around Rs 25 crore in the first week out of an outstanding of Rs 362 cr. Nimbalkar says the authorities would be quite happy if the residents paid up dues for the next year as well. Usually, collecting taxes is a big problem in Ulhasnagar which came up as a colony housing partition refugees from Pakistan’s Sindh province. Just this week, the authorities sealed a few properties as its owners had defaulted on the dues owed to the civic body.
Across Mumbai, employees of small businesses say they have been paid several months’ salaries in advance. Many of them did not show up for work afterwards as they queued up at banks to deposit the windfall. If some of the employees turn delinquent and simply take an off, there is very little their employers can do since the payments have been made in cash.
A day after the PM’s announcement, women from well-to-do families queued up at beauty parlours with wads of the big notes paying for expensive treatments in advance. The owners of these parlours themselves resorted to paying their employees a few months’ pay in advance to reduce their cash stash.
Harried public sector bankers who have to tackle huge crowds looking to exchange their currency notes too are heaving a sigh of relief as delinquent borrowers are coming forward to pay outstanding loans. None other than State Bank of India’s Chairman and managing director Arundhati Bhattacharya told reporters that bankers were on their way to meet their loan collection targets.
Contraband cash gone damp and musty after being locked away for years is being ferreted out for a cleanup. “.....we’re receiving black money that had been stashed away for years possibly and all this cash smells like rotten leather to the point where every one of our branches has ordered masks for the cashiers --  that’s how unbearable the stench became!,” a bank manager wrote in the Humans of Mumbai blog.
Meanwhile, the pain inflicted on the citizenry by the demonetization exercise is turning out to be excruciating. Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis had to intervene and crack down on private hospitals which were turning away patients who had only the banned currency notes to pay with.
Agriculture markets are shut despite the assurances of the central government. “We have told farmers not to bring in onions as we are still trying to find out ways to pay the farmers,” said an official of the Lasalgaon Agriculture Produce Marketing Committee (APMC).
The Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatana, a party which represents farmers, said crops are rotting with farmers as most of the 307 APMCs in Maharashtra are closed.

Political rivalries seem to have revived in Amritsar Central and Amritsar West constituencies, as traditional parties field candidates who were pitted against one another in 2012. Amritsar Central will see Congress’s Om Prakash Soni battling it out against BJP’s Tarun Chugh, who lost out by a margin of 12,793 votes in 2012. The constituency that comprises of commercial and residential areas inside walled city and has nearly 1.75 lakh voters, also have alternatives in AAP’s Dr Ajay Gupta and Apna Punjab Party’s young first-timer Keshav Kohli. 
While the two veteran politicos, Chugh and Soni, come with a strong lobby, development and their past performance will definitely play a big role. While the two political heavyweights will be looking to impress young voters, accessibility and their individual standing in their respective parties will definitely be one of the considering factors for the voters. 
Similarly, Amritsar West will once again see BJP’s Rakesh Gill and Congress’s Dr Rajkumar Verka have been pitted against each other. Verka had won by a margin of 11, 591 votes, while Gill trailed on the second spot. How the anti-incumbency and relative new comer fielded by AAP in this constituency, Balwinder Singh Sahota, might just be able shake things up a little, will only make the contest interesting. 
The two congress candidates were among the 42 MLA”s , who had resigned after SC decision on SYL canal. Bothe constituencies face major developmental issues, regarding civic amenities, clean drinking water supply and garbage management. 
Voter’s speak:Amritsar Central“Soni, while serving his term as city’s mayor, had initiated a lot of development work. Also, the demonetization factor might just work against the BJP candidates.  Though presence of AAP cannot be denied, but the two traditional rivals from BJP and Congress will definitely be considered as major contenders in the electoral battle,” says Rameshanand Saraswati, a resident of Shakti Nagar and voter from Amritsar Central constituency. 
“Political heavyweights always have an edge over the new comers as they come with a lot of lobbying sand support. But since this time voters will also take note of the past performances, only face value might not just get you the votes,” says Tarun Sharma, 20, engineering student and first time voter from Amritsar central.
Voter’s Speak:Amritsar West“Dr Rajkumar Verka, in his capacity as the vice chairman of national commission for scheduled caste, has a better work profile than the two other contenders. But this time, presence of third alternative will definitely put some dent in the vote share of the traditional candidates,” says Prof Kulwinder Singh, retired academician and voter from Khandwala. 
“Voters have already estimated the worth of the traditional candidates and rivals Dr Rajkumar Verka and Rakesh Gill in previous polls. Whether they have delivered in what they promised will matter a lot while casting vote. Face value does not matter if the candidates cannot deliver their promises,” says Mamta Kumari, a teacher from Kot Khalsa.

It has always been that simple — this part of running the country: remove corruption and bring maximum number of people under the tax net so that the government gets more money to spend on welfare activities, spurring demand & supply and consequently jobs. All our debates, drawing room conversations and idle-time talking centred on that. It is not that simple, we all agreed when we were told that only 1% of our population pays taxes. End of the talking.
But the present government says it has a clue to doing about the talking. The realities are bitter, the money is talking back very harshly, and the economy is projected as taking a direct hit of monetization triggered by Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Nov 8 announcement of discontinuing Rs 500/1,000 notes. The Tribune’s Sanjeev Sharma in New Delhi scans and sews together various reports to bring you the larger picture: what leading credit and rating agencies and experts say about the fallout of demonetization; various sectors of economy that may be affected in the immediate future and the scenario that may emerge in the coming months. 
The common refrain is that if the financial crisis of 2008 caused a reset for the global economy, the demonetization is a reset for the Indian economy which will bring short-term pain for at least six months, but it is considered positive in the medium to long term.
The figures: The exit of old Rs 500/1000 notes is thought to have sucked out over 85% of currency in circulation. The GDP forecasts for the financial year 2016-17 have been lowered. The consumer demand is falling; and informal sectors dependent on cash are taking a big hit.
Moody’s Investors Service: The Global rating agency, says in the immediate period, economic activity would be affected. It says households and businesses will experience liquidity shortages as cash is taken out of the system. Segments of the industry facing the consumer and retail sales are most affected. The rating agency says in the long term, greater formalization of economic and financial activity would ultimately help broaden the tax base and expand usage of the financial system. 
"Corporates will see an economic activity decline, with lower sales volumes and cash flows, with those directly exposed to retail sales being most affected." — Laura Acres, managing director, Moody’s Corporate Finance Group.
ICRA (formerly Investment Information and Credit Rating Agency of India Limited): It has revised its GDP forecasts for FY2016-17 downward by 40 basis points to 7.5 per cent. Anecdotal evidence suggests that consumers are opting for minimal discretionary purchases. Consumption-oriented sectors, particularly those which involved a sizeable magnitude of cash transactions, such as real estate, construction, jewellery, retail, travel and tourism and trade are likely to experience a lull in the immediate term.
"The forecast presumes that economic activity would resume normalcy during Q4 FY2017. Cash-based transactions in the unorganised sector would also get disrupted, particularly in rural areas." — Aditi Nayar, senior economist, ICRA Limited
Deutsche Bank Equity Research-Asia: A company note said: We may even see the autumn harvest and the winter crop sowing to be impacted, which may lead to a slower-than-anticipated growth in agricultural production which could impact the macro economy over the next two quarters, before recovering in 1QFY18. While demonetization will lead to medium term demand contraction, we see a high probability of the government following through with a growth boost in the form of a stimulus which will be articulated in the forthcoming Union Budget.
Kotak Securities: Real estate sector is likely to witness pressure on expectations of a slowdown in sales. With a squeeze on cash availability, the sector may witness lower sales which, in turn, might lead to lower prices. Volumes may get impacted as potential buyers postpone purchases on hopes of price reduction. Large players who do not have cash dealings may feel limited impact. Jewellery companies will also get impacted as they see slow-down in sales. 
The consumption sector may feel the impact as there is a temporary slowdown in spending. These companies had got impacted in the past when PAN card was made mandatory for high-value transactions. Some percentage of sales in the auto sector happens on all cash basis and that will negatively impact the sector, especially the two-wheeler demand. 
"A large part of the parallel economy is likely to flow into the formal system, which in turn will boost the GDP." — Kamlesh Rao, CEO, Kotak Securities
Retail Services, JLL India: The November 9 government initiative has impacted largely the fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) sector, in terms of distribution channels and consumption level. Food products are the leading segment, accounting for 43% of the overall market. This impact is being felt largely by small traders and the unorganised retailing segment prevalent on many high streets across the country, as compared to the organised retailing and malls, says Pankaj Renjhen, managing director.

Shimla, November 14
Himachal Pradesh Congress Committee president Sukhwinder Singh Sukhu today started ‘Vikas Pad Yatra’ under the programme “Panchayat Ek, Vikas Anek” on the birth anniversary of India’s first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru from Jubbal in Shimla district today.
Addressing party workers in the Nakrari Zila Parishad ward in Hatkoti area of Jubbal Kotkhai tehsil, Sukhu lashed out at the Narendra Modi-led government for improper planning and implementation of demonetization of currency notes of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000. He said that though it was a good scheme it had many lacunae. Chief Parliamentary Secretary Rohit Thakur also spoke on the occasion.
Sukhu announced that under ‘Panchayat Anek, Vikas Anek’ programme, conventions would be organized in all 3,236 panchayats, 251 zila parishad wards and 52 urban local bodies across the state to spread awareness about Congress party’s ideology and the state government’s achievements.
“The demonetization drive was actually started by the Congress-led UPA government in 2005 but at time, it was the BJP who had vociferously criticized the move by saying that it would affect poor people. And now, the Modi government had started the same drive without proper planning which is causing great discomfort to the poor,” he said.
HPCC president said that the Modi government was renaming the schemes that were launched by Congress-led UPA government. “Similarly, the Modi government started demonetization of currency notes but without prior planning and strategy, resulting huge loss and discomfort to the common man,” he said.
He urged the Prime Minister to also focus on the Indian soldiers who are being martyred on the border almost every day rather than remaining on tours of foreign countries. “Modi had sought votes from the general public on the basis of tall promises of bringing Achhe Din, bringing back black money, reducing prices within 100 days, increasing farmers’ income, appointing Lokpal, reducing import duty on apples and depositing Rs 15 lakh in each Indian national’s bank account,” he remarked. These promises have only proved to be hollow assurances as the Modi government had not taken any concrete steps to fulfill them.
He added that the successive Congress governments at the Centre had started various schemes for the welfare of general public which includes RTI Act, Food Security Act, Right to Education Act, MNREGA and Lokpal Bill. “These policies and programs show the philosophy of Congress-led UPA government and it also highlights the fact that Congress party has always worked for the welfare of general public of the country,” he remarked.

Delhi Pradesh Congress Committee president Ajay Maken today visited the family members of a 49-year-old man Satish Sharma, who died while standing in a long queue outside a bank at Uttam Nagar for over five hours on Monday. The Pradesh Congress Committee also gave Rs 50,000 to the family of Sharma.
Maken demanded that his family should be given proper compensation by the Union government, as the deceased was the sole breadwinner, who was working for a wholesale vegetable seller. His wife is also a severe arthritic patient.
Maken said other people who died while standing in long queues before banks and those who have died due to "note bandhi", should also be given compensation by the Modi government.
He said it was highly regrettable that the Prime Minister has not bothered to attend Parliament---the biggest platform in the country for discussions on such matters---and explain the reasons behind the chaotic implementation of demonetization. 
He said the Prime Minister speaks about such matters in rock concerts, but he was shying away from speaking in Parliament. The government should explain why demonetization was enforced, to benefit whom, as only the poor people are seen standing in queues and suffering while no rich man has been spotted standing in queues before banks. 
Maken said it was due to the failures of the government that people are suffering untold miseries.

New Delhi, December 9
Prime Minister Narendra Modi handpicked a trusted bureaucrat, little known outside India’s financial circles, to spearhead a radical move to abolish 86 per cent of the country’s cash overnight and take aim at the huge shadow economy.
Hasmukh Adhia, the bureaucrat, and five others privy to the plan were sworn to utmost secrecy, say sources with knowledge of the matter. They were supported by a young team of researchers working in two rooms at Modi’s New Delhi residence, as he plotted his boldest reform since coming to power in 2014.
When announced, the abolition of high-value bank notes of Rs 500 and 1,000 ($7.50 and $15) came as a bolt from the blue. 

(Follow The Tribune on Facebook; and Twitter @thetribunechd)
The secrecy was aimed at outflanking those who might profit from prior knowledge, by pouring cash into gold, property and other assets and hide illicit wealth.
Previously unreported details of Modi’s handling of the so-called “demonetization” open a window onto the hands-on role he played in implementing a key policy, and how he was willing to act quickly even when the risks were high.
While some advocates say the scrapping of the bank notes will bring more money into the banking system and raise tax revenues, millions of Indians are furious at having to queue for hours outside banks to exchange or deposit their old money.
Labourers have also been unpaid and produce has rotted in markets as cash stopped changing hands. Not enough replacement notes were printed in preparation for the upheaval, and it could take months for things to return to normal.
With India’s most populous state, Uttar Pradesh, holding an election in early 2017 that could decide Modi’s chances of a second term in office, there is little time for the hoped-for benefits of his cash swap to outweigh short-term pain.
Modi has staked his reputation and popularity on the move.
“I have done all the research and, if it fails, then I am to blame,” Modi told a cabinet meeting on November 8 shortly before the move was announced, according to three ministers who attended.
Direct line to Modi
Overseeing the campaign, with support from the backroom team camped out at Modi’s sprawling bungalow in the capital, was Adhia, a top finance ministry official.
The 58-year-old served as principal secretary to Modi from 2003-06 when he was chief minister of Gujarat, establishing a relationship of trust with his boss and introducing him to yoga.
Colleagues interviewed by Reuters said he had a reputation for integrity and discretion.
Adhia was named revenue secretary in September 2015, reporting formally to Finance Minister Arun Jaitley. In reality, he had a direct line to Modi and they would speak in their native Gujarati when they met to discuss issues in depth.
In the world’s largest democracy the demonetisation was revolutionary: it called into question the state’s promise to “pay the bearer” the face value on every bank note.
At a stroke, Modi scrapped money worth 15.4 trillion rupees ($220 billion), equal to 86 per cent of cash in Asia’s third-largest economy.
The idea is backed by some economists, although the speed of its implementation is widely seen as radical.
“One is never ready for this kind of disruption, but it is a constructive disruption," said Narendra Jadhav, a 31-year veteran and former chief economist of India's central bank who now represents Modi's party in the Upper House of Parliament.
Modi, in his TV address to the nation, cautioned that people could face temporary hardship as replacement Rs 500 and 2,000 notes were introduced. Calling for an act of collective sacrifice, he promised steps to soften the blow for the nine in 10 Indians who live in the cash economy.
‘Biggest, boldest step’
Immediately after the address, Adhia sent a tweet: "This is the biggest and the boldest step by the Government for containing black money."
The boast harked back to Modi's election vow to recover black money from abroad that had resonated with voters fed up with the corruption scandals that plagued the last Congress government. Yet in office, he struggled to keep his promise.
Over more than a year, Modi commissioned research from officials at the finance ministry, the central bank and think-tanks on how to advance his fight against black money, a close aide said.
He demanded answers to questions such as: How quickly India could print new bank notes; how to distribute them; would state banks benefit if they received a rush of new deposits; and who would gain from demonetisation?
The topics were broken up to prevent anyone from joining the dots and concluding that a cash swap was in the offing.
"We didn't want to let the cat out of the bag," said a senior official directly involved. "Had people got a whiff of the decision, the whole exercise would have been meaningless." Under Adhia's oversight, the team of researchers assembled and modelled the findings in what was, for it, a theoretical exercise.
It was made up of young experts in data and financial analysis; some ran Modi's social media accounts and a smartphone app that he used to solicit public feedback.
Yet for all the planning, Modi and Adhia knew they could not foresee every eventuality, and were willing to move swiftly.
The announcement caused chaos, with huge queues forming at banks when they reopened after a short holiday.
New Rs 2,000 notes were hard to come by and barely any new Rs 500 notes had been printed. India's 200,000 cash dispensers could not handle the new, smaller, notes and it would take weeks to reconfigure them.
Filling ATMs with the 8 trillion rupees ($117 billion) in new bank notes that the finance ministry reckons are needed to restore liquidity to the economy is even trickier.
In a best-case scenario, in which India's four bank note presses churned out new Rs 500 and 2,000 notes designed to replace the abolished ones, it would take at least three months to hit that target.
Secrecy paramount
Secrecy was paramount, but clues had been left.
Back in April, analysts at State Bank of India said that demonetisation of large-denomination notes was possible.
The Reserve Bank of India, the central bank, also disclosed in May that it was making preparations for a new series of bank notes that were confirmed in August when it announced it had approved a design for a new Rs 2,000 note.
The printing presses had only just started turning when the media finally started to run with the story in late October.
"The plan was to introduce it around November 18, but there was a clear sign that it could get leaked," said one person with direct knowledge who, like others interviewed by Reuters, asked not to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter.
Some officials in the finance ministry had expressed doubts about scrapping high-value notes when the idea came up for discussion. They now feel resentment at the secrecy in which Adhia rammed through the plan on Modi's orders.
They also say the plan was flawed because of a failure to ramp up printing of new notes ahead of time.
Other critics say the Adhia team fell prey to a form of "group think" that ignored outside advice.
In the words of one former top official who has worked at the finance ministry and central bank: "They don't know what's happening in the real world." Reuters

Congress vice president Rahul Gandhi, leading the protest against demonetisation in Parliament, on Wednesday said the party wanted a joint parliamentary committee probe into the “scam” involving prior leakage of the decision to a select few in the BJP.
Insisting on opposition unity moments after 12 parties joined hands to lead a protest against the move in Parliament House, the Amethi MP said all leaders also wanted Prime Minister Narendra Modi to come to Parliament, listen to them and tell the nation why he took a decision that “hit the people and economy”.

After the joint opposition protest, Rahul described demonetisation of high-denomination currency as the biggest impromptu financial experiment in the world saying the decision had hit the Indian economy. He also alleged that the Finance Minister or the Chief Economic Adviser did not know of the move, adding that the BJP organisations in Bengal and other places knew of that which explained why bank deposits surged on the eve of the announcement on November 8.
Asked how the BJP organisations could have known of the move when the FM did not, Gandhi said, “BJP organisations knew so did a few industrialist friends of the PM.”
Earlier, the Gandhi scion took swipes at the PM for addressing a pop concert and “naach gaana” saying, “The PM can give lectures to a pop concert where naach gaana is going on. Over 200 MPs are saying they want to tell the nation why he took this decision. The PM does not want to come to Parliament. Why is the PM afraid of going inside Parliament? He is obviously anxious about something.”
Gandhi said there was no division in the opposition camp about demands around demonetization, adding, “First of all we want the PM, who represents the country, to come to Parliament. He should sit in the debate. He will have to listen to us, will have to sit there. Second, we see a scam behind this move. The PM and the BJP president told their own people of the scam. We need a JPC to probe that. You see cent per cent united opposition standing here. Over 200 MPs are here. We are united. The PM should tell us why he has taken this decision.”
Gandhi said all opposition parties were fighting against black money but the question is why one decision should harass one billion people.
“It’s a question of complete centralisation of power. The country cannot be run in this manner. You have hit the economy. The economy was working well, though not as well as in the UPA time. Bengal and Kerala fishermen industry has been finished, small traders have been hit. Have you seen anyone in suit-boot in the queues?” Gandhi said accusing the PM of unilaterally taking the demonetization decision.
Asked who is leading the protest from the opposition side considering BSP chief Mayawati and SP chief Muyalam Singh were not personally part of the opposition protest on Wednesday though their MPs came, Rahul said poor people’s voice is leading this protest and MPs are representing that voice.
He said it was shameful that 70 people had died following the move and Parliament had not made any obituary reference to them.
The Congress remained adamant on its demand for an adjournment motion debate on the issue in Lok Sabha with Rahul saying, “The PM is afraid of allowing an adjournment motion.”
The government says it is ready to debate demonetisation under Rule 193 which does not entail voting unlike an adjournment notice under Rule 56 of the LS procedures.

Dharamsala, December 21
The BJP today moved no confidence resolution demanding removal of BBL Butail from the post of Speaker of the Vidhan Sabha. The resolution was submitted by the party to secretary of Vidhan Sabha. It is for the first time in the history of Himachal Vidhan Sabha that the Opposition had resorted to such an action. The BJP in resolution submitted to the secretary has leveled various allegations against the Speaker.
The BJP raised a demand for the ouster of Speaker due to tiff with him over allowing a debate in the House as demanded by Congress MLAs over the problems being faced by the people of the state due to demonetization. The BJP members maintained that the debate was listed in yesterday’s business. Since the House was adjourned yesterday all the business was also suspended. However, the Speaker allowed the debate by Congress MLAs today which was in violation of rules.
Yesterday also the BJP members had protested against the debate. They had alleged that it was they who had earlier given notice for the debate on the affect of demonetization. They had protested that the Speaker had posted their debate for December 22 while the debate demanded by Congress members was given preference.
Leader of the Opposition PK Dhumal said that the Speaker tried to conduct the House in violation of the rules. When the opposition tried to point out the violation of rules being committed by the Speaker, he said “I can change the rules.” The Speaker also stated that he can even change the Constitution of India, the BJP resolution says.
The BJP has maintained that when they pointed out the said omissions to the Speaker he reiterated that whatever he had said was right. The statement of the Speaker was disrespect to the Constitution of the country, the BJP members said in their resolution.
The Speaker, when contacted, said that he was elected by the members of the House and was ready to get down if the members wanted him to do so. He said that certain members had been disrupting the House repeatedly and were not allowing the question hour to proceed. He tried to convene meetings with the opposition member but without result. “Some members came near my chair and raised slogans. The BJP MLA Suresh Bharadwaj even sat on my chair and pronounced adjournment of the House. Such behaviour was not tolerable”, he said.
About the allegation of violations in purchase of material and recruitments in Vidhan Sabha the Speaker said that it was an administrative matter and did not pertain to the proceedings in the House. In case the BJP members wanted to take up the matter, they should do it after the session. “My primary concern was to let the house function and I have done everything to ensure that”, he said.

Dharamsala, November 29
Most of the banks in Dharamsala region remained short of cash today. All the ATMs in the region were without cash and long queues of people for getting cash were witnessed during the day. Though the government of India has fixed a withdrawal limit of Rs 24,000 per week per person, the banks in Dharamsala were not in a position to disburse even this amount.
Sources here said that the banks were giving amounts ranging from Rs 2,000 to Rs 4,000 to the customers coming for cash withdrawals. The amount being given by banks was very low keeping in view the demands of people, said Naresh Sharma, a resident of Dharamsala.
“We are just advising people to go for cashless transactions as is being advised by the Narendra Modi government,” said a bank official while speaking on the condition of anonymity.
The situation in Kangra Central Cooperative (KCC) Bank was similar. The bank was without cash as the RBI was neither giving new currency to the cooperative banks nor it was being allowed to deposit old Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 currency notes. A large number of farmers in Kangra district, especially those living in rural areas, just have one account in the bank and they are facing problems. 
Agriculture societies that supply seeds and fertilizers to the farmers in entire region also have their accounts in KCC Bank. These societies can now withdraw just Rs 50,000 per week. However, since the cooperative bank does not have cash the cooperative societies having accounts in KCC can issue only cheques. 
The sowing in entire lower Himachal has already been delayed due to lack of rains. In case the rains come the farmers would rush for supplies of seeds and fertilizers. “Due to shortage of cash we shall not be able to supply seeds and fertilizers to the farmers”, said Ram Kumar, an official in a cooperative society in Kangra. Most the business was linked to cash economy as the retail shops, small restaurants and hotels are witnessing steep fall in sales. Pankaj, who runs a restaurant, said that the business was less than 50 per cent after the government announced the demonetization move. Though most of the middle class was supporting the demonetization move of the government hoping that it would help check corruption and black money as the days are passing the patience of the people is wearing out.  

**************************************************


Post-demonetisation, the country is in a state of economic convulsion. To keep it from turning into a social seizure, the government has appealed to patriotic fervour, raising every notion from the soldier's suffering to the promise of a clean and bright financial future for the country. The poor are celebrating and the rich are losing sleep, the Prime Minister has formulated. The reality is that after a few days of initial excitement, the consequential enormity of the decision to demonetise is beginning to set in, both within the government and the masses, the poor included.
There are many who support the decision in principle but say the implementation should have been better planned. That is perhaps an unreal expectation, given the very nature of the operation. The requirement of surprise necessitated that implementation-level government hands could not be involved. A lot of the planning is thus happening in real time, as the scheme moves along. Therefore the government is constantly finessing the cash withdrawal, which only adds to the confusion and panic. Small trade has dropped drastically, daily-wage earners in the unorganised sector are missing out on employment, vegetables are rotting, farm cooperatives have been rendered inoperative for the time being, and the huge majority that was yet to enter the banking system is at its wit's end on how to exchange their old currency.
Social media, often taken as a barometer of national sentiment, has largely given a thumbs-up to the scheme. But this could be misleading, because the middle and lower middle classes that inhabit this space have alternative means of survival. The rich, who run the economy, and the rural poor are only yet forming their opinion based on their felt experience, which may not be very pleasant. The government will do well to pay heed to every section. The woeful lack of currency and means of its distribution have betrayed a lack of planning. Given the official haphazardness, who can feel assured that the implications for the long term — projected to be positive — have been calculated accurately? Tomorrow will be understood only when the dawn comes.

The demonetization after-effect since Nov 8-9 has brought out a contrarian cousin: the Information Technology sector. IT hubs such as Bangalore, Hyderabad and Pune have been largely spared of long queues of people before banks and ATMs. The reason is that most living in these cities have already shifted to a cashless society, the plastic money doing even the small chores. This is a major reflection on how the industry has remained largely unaffected by the government’s exercise to flush out black money.
After the Prime Minister announced the withdrawal of old Rs 500/1000 notes, Nasscom chairman CP Gurnani had said the Indian IT industry stood to gain in a big way. “The IT industry must adapt itself to finding solutions post cashless economy,” he said. The industry deals mostly in bills where most transactions are done digitally. Another major factor which has kept the IT industry insulated is its strong employee base, the youth, who have moved to debit and wallet money. The move will only increase the demand for digital money and lead to more use of plastic and e-wallet money, providing a great boost to companies like PayTM and Citrus.
Satish Kumar V, country head of IT solution company DMX India, said: “We have a highly structured business. This (demonetization) is a good opportunity for the industry as dependence on banking & online transactions, plus communication is set to grow exponentially. This would help players to do smarter business and maintain a transparent record. It is also a boost to the start-up segment.”
E-commerce companies, which initially took a hit will emerge stronger as the country moves towards digitization. Leading consumer internet companies have jointly hailed demonetization. Top executives from Flipkart, Snapdeal, Shopclues, CCAvenues, 1mg Technolgoies, Ola and Oyo Rooms, have welcomed the move saying it will pave the way for digital payments, aid the process of financial inclusion and the overall transformation of the economy.

KULLU, JANUARY 2
Condemning demonetization, former minister and HPCC state vice-president Chander Kumar has accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi of befooling the masses in the name of curbing corruption and black money.
He said that probe should be carried out that how much money was invested in properties and deposited by the BJP and the RSS in their accounts from March 1 to November 8 last. He stated that demonetisation move was rightly mentioned as “organised loot and legalized plunder” by former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. He added that while masses were standing in queues to withdraw limited amounts from banks, the BJP leaders were spending crores in wedding ceremonies of their kin.
He stated that even after the lapse of 50 days of the demonetization move, there was no respite for the masses. The situation had not normalized, as claimed by the Prime Minister and there was economic crisis in the country.
Chander alleged that government had failed to keep the promises made during the polls and various welfare schemes launched by the previous Congress governments were being renamed to claim political mileage. The aftereffects of the demonetization on economy, industry, employment and various other sectors would be analysed and facts would be brought before of the masses.
Ayurveda and Cooperative minister Karan Singh said that the consequences of demonetization would be faced by the BJP in the upcoming Assembly elections in the state.

Stepping up the heat on the Modi regime on the issue of demonetisation, HPCC will hold protest rallies at all district headquarters in the state on January 7.
A decision to this effect was taken at the state executive meeting of the HPCC held here today.
State Congress president Sukhwinder Singh Sukhu said a memorandum addressed to the President will be submitted to all the DCs on January 7.
“Mahila Congress will stage protests at all district headquarters to demonstrate the inconvenience caused to the general public and women because of the ill-planned and abruptly started demonetisation,” he said.
Sukhu said the traders, businessmen, farmers, labourers and the working class had been badly hit by demonetization.
“Ever after the lapse of the 50 days time sought by the Prime Minister, there is no end to the miseries of the public,” he remarked.
The Congress chief said the demonetisation had brought the wheels of development to a virtual halt and the economy is bound to suffer a major setback.
“So far 115 persons have lost their lives in a bid to get their own hard earned money withdrawn either from their bank accounts or from the ATMs,” he said.
Sukhu said the Centre was giving figures of the money deposited in banks but not of the lives lost, jobs lost and setback to the economy.

Shimla, December 5
Himachal Pradesh Congress Committee (HPCC) president Sukhwinder Singh Sukhu today criticised Prime Minister Narendra Modi for not properly planning and implementing the demonetization of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 currency notes. He was addressing a public meeting in Theog as part of “Panchayat Ek - Vikas Anek” programme launched by the party. Irrigation and Public Health (IPH) Minister Vidya Stokes, who is MLA from Theog, also addressed the gathering.
Sukhu said the BJP government had announced demonetization of currency notes of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 without any planning which has caused inconvenience to common man whether it is farmer, small trader, labourer or general public. “For the last 27 days when the demonetisation was started, general public is forced to stand in queues for hours to withdraw their hard-earned money as 86 per cent currency was declared invalid legal tender by Modi government,” he said.
He accused the Modi government of divulging the details of demonetisation before hand. The BJP had bought land across the country worth crores of rupees a few days before the implementation of decision. “There are reports that many BJP leaders have made several land deals and the deeds of 10 such transactions were done by BJP functionaries on behalf of the higher-ups”.
He further stated that under “Panchayat Anek- Vikas Anek” program, conventions would be organized in all 3,236 panchayats, 251 zila parishad wards and 52 notified area committees across the state to spread awareness about Congress party’s ideology, the state government’s achievements and also the achievements of successive Congress government’s at the Centre.

It’s true that every change needs some time and hardships have to be faced in its course of establishment, but it is the common man who has to bear the brunt. Standing in long queues has become a part of his daily chores, and that too for long durations. Bigwigs are not seen waiting for their turn to exchange or deposit money. The government should have provided ample new currency to the banks.
Rashi Srivastava, Chandigarh
Abrupt decision
The arrangements made by the government for exchange and deposit of defunct currency of Rs 1,000 and Rs 500 are appreciable and hi-tech. As the decision was announced abruptly to flush out black money from the system it created unnecessary panic among the people. The configuration and activation of ATMs should be done on priority basis in the rural areas so that pressure on nearby cities can be considerably lessened.
Bhupinder S Sealopal, Mohali
Good decision but badly timed
Demonetisation of currency is a good step to check black money but ill-timed and badly managed. Announcing the measure just before the assembly elections was not the right thing, something that has not gone down well with the opposition parties. Moreover, how will this move bring back black money stashed abroad? The money already deposited with foreign banks must have changed into currency of that country. People are being put to difficulties. The common man’s money has been lost.
Bharat Bhushan Sharma
Country halts in its tracks
The tentacles of black money struck such deep roots in Indian society that it became necessary for a surgical operation to checkmate its growth. Notwithstanding the positive effects, especially a blow to the counterfeit currency used to support  terrorism, drug mafia, the builders and so on, the demonetisation of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 currency has brought the country to a grinding halt.
SS Arora, Mohali
Loss worth crores suffered
Government action to stop the circulation of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 brought about a moderate intensity earthquake in the whole of India on the night of November 8, giving a jolt to both the rich and the poor, resulting in chaos. The nation, it appears, was on strike for two days and suffered loss worth crores due to the shutting down of all types of business and activities carried out by the rich and the poor.
AS Ahuja, Chandigarh
Poor flow of new currency
The bold action taken by the Modi Government to unearth black money, check corruption and fake currency, is a brilliant move. The only thing that needs to be done now is to make it a success. During the first ten days, there have been long queues in front of banks and ATMs, and people are still facing hardships. This is mainly due to the poor flow of new currency to the banks and the ATMs.
Colonel RD Singh (retd), Ambala Cantt
Dedicated cash vans for ATMs needed
Demonetisation of high-value notes is a welcome operation against black money, corruption and financiers of terrorists that helps in neutralising parallel economy.   However, the banks were not prepared for its execution with most ATMs running dry. To ease the problem of the common man, the government should have ensured sufficient cash in ATMs for 24 hours. To refill the ATMs, dedicated cash vans with police protection should have been arranged for.
Col Balbir Singh Mathauda (Retd)
Bold move by govt
Chanakya had said that demonetisation is a necessary evil that the government should undertake from time to time to check black money. The government has made a courageous move to check black money and bring it back into national economy besides hitting the funding of terrorism besides anti-national and anti-social activities. It is obvious from the new rules being implemented to minimise the problems.
Rakesh Chaudhry, Ambala Cantt
Poor planning
The demonetization of higher denomination currency notes is a step towards making the country free from corruption and black money. The bold and historic step by the government needs to be appreciated. But the poor planning for its implementation is causing discontentment and chaos among the poor. The most affected are those who are religiously paying their tax. The availability of new and small denomination notes must have been ensured.
Wg Cdr Jasbir Singh Minhas (retd), Mohali
Recalibrate the ATMs with Rs 100 notes
There is no denying the fact that the dust raised by demonetisation is gradually settling down. The banks did a commendable job by extending their working hours. The need of the hour is to recalibrate the ATMs primarily with Rs 100 notes as these are used by the common man. An ATM is an off-shoot of a bank account. People can enter the banks as well during working hours to withdraw money to ease the pressure on ATMs.
Nikita Kapur, Chandigarh
Hire retired bank staff
The demonetisation of Rs 500/Rs1,000 notes and permitting the public a 50-day window to deposit/exchange these in banks is a welcome step. It is aimed at cleansing the system. The RBI should direct the banks to recalibrate the ATMs to avoid inconvenience faced by the common man. Banks may hire the services of their retired employees for speedy currency swap. One can hope that the current chaos is resolved earlier than later.
Harish Kapur, Chandigarh
Mobile cash vans, token system needed
It is perhaps the most significant move to flush out black money. This also caused some hardships to the common man. Yet, despite the inconvenience, the public has been largely supportive. This decision could perhaps have been executed in a more refined manner to ensure less problems.  I have some suggestions to ease these problems. Cash flow should be normalised. Mobile cash vans for remote areas and the token system should be introduced.
Vidya Sagar Garg, Panchkula
Oppn has hijacked the issue
The government’s move to ban Rs 500 and R 1,000 currency notes was good till it was hijacked by notorious black-marketers and the Opposition parties, who just oppose the government’s move. There is no harassment to the citizens as the system already has reasonable financial provisions. Corruption, however, is rampant as dubious middle men have got the novel opportunity of exploiting the public. Non-acceptance of Rs 2,000 notes by the traders and shopkeepers, so far, is a problem.
MPS Chadha, Mohali
A bold decision
First of all, I congratulate the Prime Minister for taking this bold decision to eradicate corruption and black money. The whole country is with him. On the other hand, our management of the RBI and the Finance Department did not take into account the hardships that a common man will suffer. It would have been better if before announcing demonetization, sufficient new currency had been made available.
Tarlok Singh, Mani Majra
Don’t succumb to pressure
Although the random decision of demonetising the currency has made the common man suffer, yet benefits seem to be in store. The Prime Minister`s assurance of taking more stern steps in the near future has strengthened the will of the general public. Therefore, the government should not bow before any pressure to halt the reforms.
Surinder Paul Wadhwa, Mohali
Lower strata of society affected
The demonetisation of currency notes of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 is timely. It will definitely eradicate corruption, black money and fake currency notes. The lower middle class and the lower income groups are facing problems because most of them do not have high-value notes and live on daily earnings. The small value notes are not available with the general public, leading to great difficulty.
RK Kapoor, Chandigarh
PM deserves kudos
The surprise announcement by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on November 8 was no less than a surgical strike on the country’s black money hoarders and for this, he deserves to be
congratulated, especially because the announcement caught several hoarders napping. But the government functionaries were also simultaneously caught unawares and the move exposed the irresponsible and utterly reckless attitude towards the ground realities.
Group Captain (retd) Samaresh Kumar Goswami, Panchkula
A masterstroke
The surprise announcement by the PM was definitely a master stroke and he definitely succeeded in inflicting an unexpected blow on the internal economy to flush out black money from the coffers of the hoarders, who had no option but to accept the announcement, forcing them to run helter-skelter from the jewellery shops to foreign exchange dealers or to the real estate dealers to convert their black money into white.
Raj Kumari, Panchkula
Common man frustrated
The Prime Minister’s bombshell dropped on the night of November 8 made the  man on  the  road run  for  cover. The  news of  banks  being closed the next day  and  the  ATMs for  two days,  added  to  the discomfiture  of all those  who  did not  have smaller  currency  for  two days to purchase the essentials  of  daily  need. Frustration due to denial of own money and anxiety drove everyone  to  the banks  and  ATMs.
SC Luthra, Mani Majra
Charity has begun at home
I welcome the move by our Prime Minister to flush out black money. The inconvenience being caused is temporary and that too for a short time but in the long run, people will feel good. It is true that the Prime Minister promised during his election campaign to bring back black money from abroad but as the popular saying goes, “Charity begins at home”.
Ujagar Singh, Chandigarh
Weddings affected
A lot of inconvenience is being experienced by the people who have fixed the marriages of their children these days, as expenses, both planned and unforeseen, are involved. Imagine the plight of a person whose ward’s marriage is fixed. He must have lakhs of rupees in cash handy to meet the expenses involved. No measures or guidelines have been laid for this exigency.

Gujarat farmers are keeping their fingers crossed. After 20 days of “no banking” since district central co-operative banks were barred from transacting any business, they still don’t know when the central government-promised loan from NABARD will trickle down. Their rabi crop sowing is already delayed by about a fortnight. “When will the crops be sown and how will the farmers and their cattle survive all these days,” asks Gujarat Khedut Samaj secretary Sagar Rabari. 
Gujarat’s farming community is probably the worst hit because the state has a strong network of co-operatives. These banks play a very important role in rural areas where over half of the farmers are account holders in co-operative banks. 
About 15-20% farmers in the state still do not have any bank account and deal only in cash. They will have to wait till the cash reaches the near pre-demonetization level.
Senior BJP leaders, including the one-time close aide of PM Modi and the chairman of the National Federation of State Co-operative Banks Dillip Sanghani has already expressed his anger. And so has Gujarat chief minister Vijay Rupani. Yet the Reserve Bank of India has refused to reverse its order banning these banks from either exchanging or depositing now-defunct notes. The account holders are allowed to withdraw from their accounts but that is only in name, no cash has reached the rural co-operative banks since the demonetization. Last week Sanghani met Modi in Delhi informing him about the farmers’ woes. And Rupani personally took up the matter with finance minister Arun Jaitley and the RBI governor Urjit Patel, but nothing has happened. 
“The farmers could not clear the old loan as they have mostly the defunct notes,” the manager of a co-operative bank pointed out. They are in a fix over meeting their daily household expenses, including arranging fodder for their cattle. “We also do not know when the money sanctioned by NABARD will reach the villages,” said a bank manager.

It has always been that simple — this part of running the country: remove corruption and bring maximum number of people under the tax net so that the government gets more money to spend on welfare activities, spurring demand & supply and consequently jobs. All our debates, drawing room conversations and idle-time talking centred on that. It is not that simple, we all agreed when we were told that only 1% of our population pays taxes. End of the talking.
But the present government says it has a clue to doing about the talking. The realities are bitter, the money is talking back very harshly, and the economy is projected as taking a direct hit of monetization triggered by Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Nov 8 announcement of discontinuing Rs 500/1,000 notes. The Tribune’s Sanjeev Sharma in New Delhi scans and sews together various reports to bring you the larger picture: what leading credit and rating agencies and experts say about the fallout of demonetization; various sectors of economy that may be affected in the immediate future and the scenario that may emerge in the coming months. 
The common refrain is that if the financial crisis of 2008 caused a reset for the global economy, the demonetization is a reset for the Indian economy which will bring short-term pain for at least six months, but it is considered positive in the medium to long term.
The figures: The exit of old Rs 500/1000 notes is thought to have sucked out over 85% of currency in circulation. The GDP forecasts for the financial year 2016-17 have been lowered. The consumer demand is falling; and informal sectors dependent on cash are taking a big hit.
Moody’s Investors Service: The Global rating agency, says in the immediate period, economic activity would be affected. It says households and businesses will experience liquidity shortages as cash is taken out of the system. Segments of the industry facing the consumer and retail sales are most affected. The rating agency says in the long term, greater formalization of economic and financial activity would ultimately help broaden the tax base and expand usage of the financial system. 
"Corporates will see an economic activity decline, with lower sales volumes and cash flows, with those directly exposed to retail sales being most affected." — Laura Acres, managing director, Moody’s Corporate Finance Group.
ICRA (formerly Investment Information and Credit Rating Agency of India Limited): It has revised its GDP forecasts for FY2016-17 downward by 40 basis points to 7.5 per cent. Anecdotal evidence suggests that consumers are opting for minimal discretionary purchases. Consumption-oriented sectors, particularly those which involved a sizeable magnitude of cash transactions, such as real estate, construction, jewellery, retail, travel and tourism and trade are likely to experience a lull in the immediate term.
"The forecast presumes that economic activity would resume normalcy during Q4 FY2017. Cash-based transactions in the unorganised sector would also get disrupted, particularly in rural areas." — Aditi Nayar, senior economist, ICRA Limited
Deutsche Bank Equity Research-Asia: A company note said: We may even see the autumn harvest and the winter crop sowing to be impacted, which may lead to a slower-than-anticipated growth in agricultural production which could impact the macro economy over the next two quarters, before recovering in 1QFY18. While demonetization will lead to medium term demand contraction, we see a high probability of the government following through with a growth boost in the form of a stimulus which will be articulated in the forthcoming Union Budget.
Kotak Securities: Real estate sector is likely to witness pressure on expectations of a slowdown in sales. With a squeeze on cash availability, the sector may witness lower sales which, in turn, might lead to lower prices. Volumes may get impacted as potential buyers postpone purchases on hopes of price reduction. Large players who do not have cash dealings may feel limited impact. Jewellery companies will also get impacted as they see slow-down in sales. 
The consumption sector may feel the impact as there is a temporary slowdown in spending. These companies had got impacted in the past when PAN card was made mandatory for high-value transactions. Some percentage of sales in the auto sector happens on all cash basis and that will negatively impact the sector, especially the two-wheeler demand. 
"A large part of the parallel economy is likely to flow into the formal system, which in turn will boost the GDP." — Kamlesh Rao, CEO, Kotak Securities
Retail Services, JLL India: The November 9 government initiative has impacted largely the fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) sector, in terms of distribution channels and consumption level. Food products are the leading segment, accounting for 43% of the overall market. This impact is being felt largely by small traders and the unorganised retailing segment prevalent on many high streets across the country, as compared to the organised retailing and malls, says Pankaj Renjhen, managing director.

Chandigarh, December 12
Perturbed over huge shortage of currency, bank unions affiliated to All India Bank Employees Association (AIBEA) and All India Bank officers Associations (AIBOA) will hold demonstration here on December 14. However, bank unions confirmed that normal work will not be disrupted. Except SBI, all other banks will join the agitation.
The union has demanded that the RBI should take steps to supply adequate cash to all banks and details of notes supplied to banks should be announced publicly by RBI on a daily basis. The unions also demanded that if RBI is not able to supply adequate cash to banks, then decision should be taken to suspend cash transactions in the bank branches till sufficient cash is supplied.
In a letter to bank unions, the AIBEA and the AIBOA said, for the past one month, employees and officers in the banks had been undergoing extraordinary pressure of work and stress for implementing the demonetization.
“When everyone was expecting that things would improve and there would be respite, new problems have arisen and employees and officers continue to face the wrath of the customers and public. Even though RBI is making statements that enough cash is being supplied to banks, in reality we all know that there is an acute shortage of cash supply to banks from RBI,” CH Venkatachalam, general secretaery, AIBEA wrote in a letter to member unions.

New Delhi, December 3   
Unmindful of murmurs in the opposition over his stand on demonetisation, Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar on Saturday maintained his support to the exercise, asserting that he will back any attack on corruption irrespective of party affiliations.
Often seen as a possible opposition candidate for prime ministership in 2019 Lok Sabha polls, he said no serious attempt is currently being made to bring together non-BJP parties.
A grand alliance of the opposition parties at the national level is certain to win the elections but no such scene was in sight, he said.
He asserted there is no problem in the ruling grand alliance in Bihar and mocked speculation about his growing proximity with BJP, saying he would not offer denial on all kinds of reports as denial is 50 per cent confirmation.
Kumar's strong support to 'notebandi', which has riled leaders like TMC chief Mamata Banerjee, came at a meeting organised by his party JD (U) and later at HT Leadership Summit even as another top leader of his party Sharad Yadav targeted the Modi government over demonetisation in his presence.
"This 'notebandi' is a positive step which will lead to benefits. It will happen," the JD (U) President said, terming corruption and black money as a "big sin and festering wound" which must be eradicated.
"Severe steps will have to be taken. That is why we offered our support to this (demonetization). It is a positive beginning... Whenever there is an attack on corruption, I will support it," he said.
The JD (U) president also refrained from criticism on the manner of its implementation causing inconvenience to people, an issue vociferously raised by the opposition and his party colleague Yadav.
Asked about Yadav and other opposition parties raising the issue of people's difficulties, he said: "I don't speak about it because those facing difficulties should be speaking. No such voice is being heard. People are in difficulty but the poor thinks he is facing problem today but a lot of money of the rich is sinking."
Yadav is highlighting these difficulties, Kumar said, adding that there is no problem in that. "We have no difference of opinion."  PTI

Russia has strongly protested with India on cash shortage affecting the working of its Mission after demonetisation, and wants a quick resolution of the issue, failing which it may explore other options, including summoning Indian diplomat in Moscow.
(Follow The Tribune on Facebook; and Twitter @thetribunechd)
In a letter, Russian Ambassador Alaxander Kadakin has raised the issue of diplomats not being able to withdraw enough money hampering the normal functioning of the mission and sought intervention of the External Affairs Ministry so that the withdrawal restrictions for diplomatic staff are lifted.
"We are awaiting a reply from the MEA and hope that this is resolved quickly. Otherwise, we will be forced to explore other options which may include raising the issue in Moscow with your Embassy by summoning Indian Minister Counsellor," a senior Russian embassy official said here.
Other options may also include restriction on the cash withdrawals for Indian diplomats posted in Russia, the official indicated.
There are approximately 200 staffers in Russian mission here.
There was no immediate reaction from the Indian side on the complaint.
Earlier, the Dean of Diplomatic Corps had also raised the issue, complaining about the problems faced by the missions.
It is also understood that some other countries like Ukraine and Kazakhstan have also protested to the ministry.
After the demonetization last month, MEA had said it has approached Department of Economic Affairs over three or four types of requests including those related to maintaining sufficient flow of funds to diplomatic missions following the demonetization and was awaiting a decision from it. —PTI
