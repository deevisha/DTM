
NEW DELHI: The Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday told the parliamentary Board meeting of the BJP that the decision on demonetization is just the beginning of a long battle against black money and corruption. The Parliamentary Board of the BJP in a resolution endorsed the Prime Minister’s “crusade” against black money and corruption.
The Prime Minister during his first speech to the BJP MPs in the ongoing Winter session of Parliament got emotional, saying that his decisions are not for personal gains but for benefit of the people. The BJP leaders afterwards explained that the Prime Minister had been peeved at personal attacks by the MPs of the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha in the Parliament on the agitation against demonetization.
"We have come to power not for personal benefits or toi benefit those who we know, but for the poor. The common men suffered for 70 years on account of black money, corruption and terrorism,” Modi said. The Prime Minister also stated that his government would not waver from the path to eliminate black money. He recalled that the government had also taken a few measures, including setting up of a SIT on black money and Income Disclosure Scheme, 2016.
“Demonetisation is not the end but beginning of a long, deep and constant battle against black money and corruption. It will benefit the poor and the common man. The poor and the lower and middle classes have suffered the most due to black money, counterfeit currency and corruption,” said Modi.
The BJP MPs gave standing ovation to the Prime Minister, while slogans were reportedly raised to hail the decision on demonetization. Modi stated that the economy would come out much stronger after the implementation of the decision on demonetisation.
Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitely told the BJP MPs that the demonetisation would help India embrace digital economy.

HOW BHARAT COPES: Falling back on the forest economy
KUTTAMPUZHA: More than 10 days after the government scrapped the 500 and 1,000 rupee notes, ration shop dealer Natarajan of Kallelimedu, a remote forest area in Ernakulam district of Kerala, is still accepting the old notes from the Adivasis of Kunjippara, Variyam, Thalavachapra and Thera tribal colonies in Kuttampuzha panchayat.
Natarajan said this is part of his symbiotic relationship with the tribals. “Most of these people have only old notes. To reach the bank at Kuttampuzha they have to shell out Rs 2,000 for the jeep trip. So I accept the old denominations," he says.

Most of the people here keep an ‘account’ with Natarajan. “If they don't have the money, I give them credit. They repay me whenever they get the money,” he says.
Kallelimedu has two groceries, one tea shop and a ration shop and serves as the shopping centre for 265 tribal families in the area. Demonetization hasn’t affected them at all. "Only if the crisis affects Kallelimedu do we need to worry.
We don't have big savings like city people.  What we get from the forest is enough for us," said Alli, the Kaanikkaran (tribal leader), who came to know about demonetization from local jeep drivers on Nov. 9.
While the men in these tribal colonies earn their living as labourers, the women are engaged in MNREGS work and bamboo weaving. "We all have bank accounts. MNREGS credits our payment in the bank. We go to the bank once in two or three months to take out our money. We don't need large amounts to run the household here," said Anumol, a tribal woman.
But though demonetization hasn’t impacted these families, the state government's policy of categorizing ration cards as Priority and Non-priority has. “As part of the Priority and Non-priority system, the government has taken our ration cards.
So we cannot collect rice from the ration shops at the moment. We are now forced to buy rice for a higher price.
Though demonetization has not affected us, the state government's policy has hit us badly," said Kanji, an Adivasi woman and a member of the Kuttampuzha gram panchayat.

BENGALURU: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is expected to cut interest rates next week and economists are set to chop growth and inflation forecasts after Prime Minister Narendra Modi's currency crackdown rattled the economy and severely hurt consumption, a Reuters poll showed.
Modi's outlawing of high-value bank notes last month, aimed at curbing corruption and tax evasion, has left the nation's 1.2 billion population scrambling to exchange old notes for new and left many companies' cash-reliant supply chains in tatters.
India's economy expanded 7.3 percent in the July-September quarter from a year earlier, making it the fastest growing major country in the world. But it could easily lose top spot if some of the more pessimistic views that suggest growth could halve post-demonetization come true.
It could also drag inflation down. At 4.2 percent in October, it is below the central bank's early-2018 target of 5 percent.
The median forecast in the poll of nearly 60 economists this week was that the RBI's recently formed Monetary Policy Committee will cut the repo rate by 25 basis points (bps) to 6.00 percent when it concludes its two-day meeting on Dec. 7 from 6.25 percent now.
Two-thirds of the respondents expected a cut, with 31 of 56 respondents expecting it to be 25 bps, while six predicted a deeper 50 bps reduction. One said the RBI would slash rates by 75 bps.
"Given the concerns about demonetization and the slowdown it is likely to generate in sectors that have traditionally been cash dependant, such as consumption goods, the RBI will try to cushion the blow with a rate cut," said Shilan Shah of Capital Economics in Singapore.
Still, 18 analysts forecast no move next week. Only four of them were based in India, suggesting domestic banks and research houses closer to the real impact from the policy generally held a more negative view on the effects of demonetization.
Consumer spending accounts for over half of India's output and the overnight withdrawal of 86 percent of the currency in circulation has left farmers, households and even companies struggling to meet their daily needs.
The rupee has weakened some 3 percent in recent weeks to record lows. although a Reuters poll this week showed it is unlikely to continue falling.
The deluge of cash pouring into banks has resulted in excess liquidity, which the RBI tried to mop up with a temporary hike to its reserve requirements last week. The poll found the cash reserve ratio will be kept unchanged at 4 percent in December.
The reverse repo rate, which moves in tandem with the main lending rate and is the interest the RBI pays to soak up funds, is expected to be cut to 5.50 percent from 5.75 percent.
After next week, the consensus is that a final 25 bps rate cut will come in the April-June quarter.
The RBI has chopped rates by 175 bps since January 2015 on a global disinflation trend from lower energy prices and slowing growth.
"With the banking system flush with liquidity, monetary policy transmission should be better in the months ahead. We expect the RBI to use the potential impact of demonetization as a rationale for further rate cuts," said Kaushik Basu, economist at Deutsche Bank in Mumbai.
While there is no clear indication on how much of a hit growth is likely to take as a result of Modi's demonetization drive, economists are certain it won't be minor.
All but one of the 29 respondents to a separate question in the survey said they would be downgrading near-term growth forecasts as a result of demonetization. The vast majority of them also said the outlook for inflation would be lowered.
Analysts generally agree that under the newly-formed Monetary Policy Committee chaired by Urjit Patel, the RBI's stance has drifted somewhat away from former Governor Raguhuram Rajan's priority on inflation towards underpinning growth.
"The RBI put its credibility on the line by cutting rates the last time in October when there were still concerns that it wouldn't meet its inflation target," said Shah of Capital Economics, adding: "that is a clear departure from how monetary policy was run under the previous governor Raghuram Rajan."

SRINAGAR: Contradicting Union Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar’s statement that demonetization ended stone pelting in Kashmir, the PDP-BJP coalition government in Jammu and Kashmir on Monday said there was no impact of demonetization on unrest in the Valley.
“The State government has not received any report so far on effects of demonetization on the recent unrest in the Valley,” J&K Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti, who also holds the Home portfolio, said in a written reply in State’s Legislative Assembly in Jammu, winter capital of Jammu and Kashmir.
She was responding to a question by State BJP president and MLA Sat Paul Sharma. The MLA had sought information from government on the effects of the demonetization on the recent unrest in the Valley.
The CM in her written reply also revealed that no case has been received about fake currency being used for generating violence during the unrest.
Kashmir witnessed over five months long unrest after killing of 21-year-old Hizbul Mujahideen commander Burhan Wani in an encounter with security forces in South Kashmir’s Kokernag area on July 8.
After his killing, the Kashmir used to witness dozens of incidents of protests and stone pelting every day.  At least 94 people including two policemen were killed and over 13000 injured during the five month long unrest.
On the call of separatists, Valley observed continuously shutdown for over four months. However, with the improvement in situation, the protests and stone pelting subsided and separatists scaled down the “protest and shutdown” calendar.
The State government’s today’s statement is contrary to Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar.
On November 14, a week after Prime Minister announced scrapping of Rs 500 and 1000 notes, Parrikar had stated that since the demonetization, terror funding has come down to zero and there hasn’t been stone-pelting on security forces in Kashmir.
“In the last few days after PM’s daring move, there hasn’t been stone pelting on security forces. Earlier, there were rates: Rs 500 for stone pelting (on security forces in Kashmir) and Rs 1,000 for doing something else. PM has brought terror funding to zero,” Parrikar had said.
Meanwhile, the State government informed the Legislative Assembly today that hawala money was being used to fund militant activities and 173 hawala cases were registered in the State in last 15 years.
"As per reports from CID, hawala channels are being used to fund militant violence in the state. Since 2001, 173 hawala cases have been registered,” the government disclosed.
It stated that of the 173 cases, 90 cases have been challaned, 45 cases are under investigation, nine cases were untraced and six not admitted
“The sanction is awaited in 23 cases,” added the government.

Politicians and those with hangers-on always find a way around the law, as reports suggest. In one instance, a politician in Karnataka despatched his cronies with Rs 1 lakh to Rs 2 lakh in cash of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 denominations to get them exchanged and thus “laundered” clean white.  These were the kind of people former RBI governor Raghuram Rajan was referring to when he said demonetisation had been considered in the past but not thought to be effective.
“My sense is the clever find ways around it. They find ways to divide up their hoard into many smaller pieces,” he had said at an interaction after delivering the Lalit Doshi Memorial lecture in August 2014. An audience member had asked a question about RBI’s proposal to phase out old notes that do not have the year printed on them, and Rajan had said that demonetisation had been considered as an option to get rid of black money but he didn’t think it would work.
He reasoned that the need of the hour was to focus the incentives that generate and retain black money. Adding that most of the black money might be stocked in the form of gold, which would make it harder for the administration to track or catch.
Stressing on the need to implement a better tax system, Rajan said India’s taxes were among the lowest and therefore there was no reason why people should not pay their dues. In such a situation, better data tracking mechanism and tax administration will go a long way in keeping track of where money is not being declared, he said. “I think it is very hard in this modern economy to hide your money that easily,” he added.
Here is the extract of Rajan’s interaction where he spoke about demonetization.
Question: RBI’s proposal to phase out old notes which do not have the year printed. Suggestion – a: Replacing old currency notes under a new series. b: Also consider adding new series of Notes with Rabindranath Tagore, Homi Bhabha, et al.
Response: I am not quite sure if what you meant is demonetise the old notes and introduce new notes instead. In the past demonetisation has been thought off as a way of getting black money out of circulation. Because people then have to come and say “how do I have this ten crores in cash sitting in my safe” and they have to explain where they got the money from. It is often cited as a solution. 
Unfortunately, my sense is the clever find ways around it. They find ways to divide up their hoard in to many smaller pieces. You do find that people who haven’t thought of a way to convert black to white, throw it into the Hundi in some temples. I think there are ways around demonetization. It is not that easy to flush out the black money. Of course, a fair amount may be in the form of gold, therefore even harder to catch. 
I would focus more on the incentives to generate and retain black money. A lot of the incentives are on taxes. My sense is the current tax rate in this country is for the most part reasonable. We have a reasonable tax regime, for example, the maximum tax rate on high-incomes is 33%, in the US it is already 39% plus State taxes, etc., it takes it to near 50. We are actually lower than many industrial countries. 
Given that, there is no reason why everybody who should pay taxes is not paying taxes. I would focus more on tracking data and better tax administration to get at where money is not being declared. I think it is very hard in this modern economy to hide your money that easily.

NEW DELHI: The breakthrough in the impasse in Parliament remained elusive on Wednesday, as the Opposition persisting with demands for obituaries for soldiers killed in the Nagrota terror attack and
people who died on account of the decision on demonetization. The Opposition apparently hardening its stance will meet President on Thursday to raise the issue of the manner in which the Taxation Laws
(Second Amendment)Bill, 2016 was passed in the Lok Sabha without the House being in order.
The government remained unfazed over the Opposition sticking to the disruptive tactics. “The Taxation Laws (Second Amendment) Bill is now before the Rajya Sabha and counting of days has already
begun. After 14 days, the Bill will be deemed to have been passed even if the Rajya Sabha does not take up the legislative proposal to give effect to the tax provisions linked to demonetization. The taxation
proposals will be applicable for the 1016-17 financial year,” said a Union Minister.
Lok Sabha witnessed uproarious scenes from the moment the House was convened with the Opposition MPs trooping into the well with demands for obituaries for soldiers killed in the Nagrota attack and
those who died standing in the queue outside banks and ATMs. Speaker Sumitra Mahajan rejected the Opposition demands for obituary on the ground that the anti-terror operation in Nagrota still had been
underway.
The Rajya Sabha also witnessed similar disruptions even while the leader of the House and Finance Minister Arun Jaitely assured the House of the readiness of the government to discuss the
Nagrota terror attack. He also exhorted the Opposition to complete the discussion on demonetization. However, there was no respite from pandemonium in the Upper House, leading to repeated
adjournments of the proceedings.
The Trinamool Congress MP Sukhendu Shekhar Roy had given a notice under Rule 267 for taking up obituaries for the martyrs of Nagrota attack and “82 people who died in queue due to demonetization”. He was supported by the leader of the Opposition Ghulam Nabi Azad.
"It is a serious issue if the House is not ready to pay obituary to brave soldiers and those who died because of the wrong policies of the government,” Azad said.
Amid the ruckus, Jaitely and the JD (U) MP Sharad Yadav exchanged spats on the issue of demonetization. Jaitely shot back to Yadav, that his leader and Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar supported the decision on demonetization. Yadav snapped, saying his party has been protesting the implementation and not the decision.
The Opposition in Lok Sabha said that they are ready for debate on demonetization under any rule that entails voting. There was unanimous view that the opposition is seeking division not over black money
or demonetization but problem faced by people and states due to demonetization. Congress leader in the Lok Sabha Mallikarjun Kharge exhorted Speaker to hold discussion under any rule that will have
voting and that they are ready for debate.
TMC leader Sudip Bandhopadhyay questioned that why the government with a brute majority of over 300 MPs is running away from voting and they are ready to shift from discussion under rule 56 for the
sake of the country provided the government changes its stands for discussion under rule 193.         
Even BJD joined the opposition and party MP Bhartruhari Mahtab making it clear that they are against black money and demonetization but they want division over problems faced by people due to the
whole process. 
The speaker said that the opposition is demanding discussion under Rule 56 that entails voting while the Government wants it under 193 which doesn’t have provision for division.
“I am ready to suspend the zero hour and start the discussion immediately,” said Mahajan.        
But the opposition continued with its protests and the house was adjourned twice before being adjourned for the day.

It has been 14 days since Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s surgical attack on Rs 500 and Rs 1000 currency notes turned the country’s largely cash-based economy upside down, leaving the public queuing up at ATMs and banks. And now he is seeking a feedback.
On Tuesday, the PM asked people to log onto his app (NARENDRA MODI APP) to take a survey of 10 questions. The tech- savvy PM tweeted, "I want your first-hand view on the decision taken regarding currency notes. Take part in the survey on the NMApp.

One of the questions in the survey on the App

The survey uses some nifty reverse psychology. It begins with some innocuous queries phrased like a catechism (religious questionnaires in which there is only one answer). Take the first question: “Do you think black money exists in India?” And then, the second: “Do you think the evil of corruption and black money needs to be fought and eliminated?”
The two answers given are ‘yes’ and ‘no’. No prizes for guessing which way the responses will go.
The survey comes to the crux in the latter half of the test, which includes questions like, “Do you think demonetisation will bring real estate, higher education, healthcare in common man’s reach?, to which the respondents have to either  ‘completely agree’ or  ‘partially agree’ or ‘can't say’. There is no ‘disagree’ option.
The ninth question is even more leading and pre-loaded: “Do you believe some anti-corruption activists are now actually fighting in support of black money, corruption and terrorism?” Now, what do you say to that if you have spent every day in the past 14 days standing in a line at the ATM and living off your loose change? The respondent gets the feeling that anybody with an opposing view would be seen as pro-corruption, pro-black money, pro-terrorism and eventually, an anti-national.
It’s clear what sort of findings are likely to come from this survey. But a fuller questionnaire might have brought home to the Prime Minister a clearer picture of the situation on the ground.
Here are some questions Narendra Modi’s survey does not ask:

Do you have any money with you now?
How long have you had to stand in the queues before you could withdraw/exchange some of your money?
Are the ATMs/ banks in your locality being steadily supplied with cash?
Did you have to forego any potential opportunity pertaining to career/personal life due to the currency shortage?
Do you think the move should have been implemented in a phased manner?
Has the move disrupted your regular routine?
Has the move caused any inconvenience to you or anybody that you know?
Whom do you think the move has affected the most in the hierarchal ladder of India’s economy? The rich, the middle class or the poor?
Are you finding it difficult to use the new currency of Rs 2,000 in the market?

And here are the questions that PM Modi did ask:

Do you think that black money exists in India?
Do you think the evil of corruption and blackmoney needs to be fought and eliminated?
Overall, what do you think about the Government’s moves to tackle black money?
What do you think of Government’s efforts against corruption so far?
What do you think of the Modi Government’s move of banning old Rs 500 & Rs 1,000 notes?
Will it bring real estate,education, healthcare in the common man’s reach
Did you mind the inconvenience faced in our fight to curb corruption, black money, terrorism and counterfeiting of currency?
Do you believe some anti-corruption activists are now actually fighting in support of black money, corruption & terrorism?
Do you have any suggestions, ideas or insights you would like to share with PM Modi?

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The demonetization of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 currency notes has hit tipplers in Kerala, with liquor sales dropping leading to a consequent drop in its contribution to the state exchequer.
According to figures from the sole wholesaler of liquor and beer in the state - Kerala State Beverages Corporation, that has an average daily sales of close to Rs 29 crore, since Tuesday it has dipped to below Rs 20 crore.
Since Tuesday midnight after Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 denominations were pulled out by the government, the daily sale of liquor fell to Rs 18 crore on Wednesday, from Rs 29 crore the previous day.
On Thursday, the sales climbed to Rs 20.15 crore and on Friday it fell below the Rs 20 crore mark.
Taxes that come to the state exchequer from the sale of liquor and beer account for as high as 80 per cent of the total sales value. With around 30 per cent drop in daily sales, the state will feel the heat more in raising funds.
The total sales of KSBC for the month of October was Rs 1,030 crore.
According to studies, the profile of liquor users reveals that around 32.9 lakh people of the 3.34 crore population in the state consumes liquor, which includes 29.8 lakh men and 3.1 lakh women.
Around five lakh people consume liquor on a daily basis. Of this, around 83,851 people, including 1,043 women, are addicted to alcohol.

NEW DELHI:  Former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on Thursday termed government’s demonetization as monumental management failure and urged Prime Minister, Narendra Modi to find a practical and pragmatic solution to deal with black money.
"I want to ask PM, can he name any country where people have deposited their money but are not able to withdraw it?", said Manmohan Singh in the Rajya Sabha, attacking Modi’s decision on demonetizing Rs 500 and Rs 1000 currency notes, as Modi looked at him.
The PM turned up before the House after relentless opposition continued with their demand for the PM to be present during the discussion on demonetization, for the seventh day since the Parliament started on November 16.
The House was suspended half an hour after it met at 11 am with angry opposition persisted with their demand for the PM to be present at the discussion.
Manmohan Singh who was allowed to speak on demonetization after the PM Modi came to the House at 12 pm accused Narendra Modi government for hurting agriculture, small businesses and informal sector and stated that the GDP would see a decline of at least 2 % due to demonetization.
"We don't disagree with the objective of fighting graft but it was a monumental management failure the way it was done. It's a case of organised loot and legalised plunder," Singh said after Rajya Sabha resumed debate on demonetisation in Prime Minister Narendra Modi's presence.
"It is important to take note of the grievances of the people suffering. Around 60 to 65 people have lost their lives, what has been done can weaken our people's confidence in currency and banking system," he pointed out.
Stating that the PM had asked people to wait for 50 days but for the poor section even 50 days can be detrimental, Singh pointed out.
He also expressed concern over RBI modifying rules repeatedly.
"It is not good that every day the banking system comes out with modification. The cooperative banks which are serving larger part of rural India is not operational. PM must come with some constructive proposal on how we can implement the scheme."
Soon after Singh ended his speech BSP supremo Mayawati demanded that PM hold fresh elections to know the people's view on demonetisation.
"I want to tell Prime Minister Narendra Modi that if you really are an honest man and want a correct survey and if you have guts, then dissolve Parliament and hold fresh elections," she said.
Her remarks came a day after the PMO said that more than 93 per cent of the five lakh people who participated in a survey on Narendra Modi App have supported demonetisation.
The issue of demonetisation has rocked both the Houses since the commencement of the winter session.
However, the House proceedings were halted for an hour for lunch at 1 a.m Before leaving the House the PM spoke to opposition members including Leader of the Opposition Ghulam Nabi Azad and Anand Sharma besides Sharad Yadav and others.
Earlier in the day, opposition parties decided not to hold talks with the government over demonetization till November 28 when they will mark the 'Aakrosh Diwas'.

NEW DELHI: Amid growing protest by the opposition against demonetization, Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar today again voiced support to the Modi government's decision, saying it is a positive step which will lead to benefits.
"This 'notebandi' is a positive step which will lead to benefits. It will happen," he said addressing a JD(U) meeting, where differences in the party came in the open as former party chief Sharad Yadav targeted the Modi dispensation over demonetization.
Terming corruption and black money as a big sin and a "festering wound" which must be eradicated, Kumar said, "Severe steps will have to be taken. That is why we offered our support to this (demonetization). It is a positive beginning."
The JD(U) president also refrained from any criticism on the implementation issue, which has been vociferously raised by the opposition.
He, however, added that demonetization alone will not end black money.
He asked Prime Minister Narendra Modi to also launch a crackdown on benami properties immediately and target black money hoarded in assets like gold and diamonds.
"Currency forms a significant part of black money but total black money is much more than that. The country's money has been laundered to overseas as well and that too should be brought back," he said.
Kumar's remarks in support of demonetization, which has united most of the opposition parties against it, came after Yadav hit out at Modi dispensation over the issue.
Yadav alleged the decision is aimed at capitalising banks that were "sinking" due to Rs 8.5 lakh crore of NPA and its goal is not to target black money.
The decision has forced the entire country to stand in a queue, said Yadav, who played an active role in rallying opposition's protests before Kumar declared his support to demonetization.
He, however, also spoke in the same vein that his party supports the step but is critical of the ill-prepared manner in which it was executed.
Kumar, however, did not touch on the implementation part of demonetization, merely saying that his government does everything with due preparation and so should the Centre.
"We support demonetization. It should be implemented with preparation. We do our work with full preparation. They (Centre) should also have done that.
"We said there can be nothing better if it helps curb corruption, bring out some amount of black money and illegal work is stopped to some extent," he said.

NEW DELHI: The BJP has issued whip to party’s Rajya Sabha MPs for three days from Monday in a bid to put up a strong presence when the Upper House resumes discussions on demonetization. The BJP is sticking with confrontationist approach against the remark of the leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha Ghulam Nabi Azad.
“The Parliamentary office of the BJP has issued whip to all the party MPs of the Rajya Sabha to remain present in the proceedings of the House on November 21, 22 and 23. The whip is to ensure that the treasury benches show the full strength when discussions on demonetization are taken up, besides a few legislative bills may also be taken up,” sources in the BJP Parliamentary Board said.
Meanwhile, the Union Ministers on Saturday came out strongly against protests over demonetization, while accusing the Opposition of indulging into fear-mongering. Union Minister for Home Affairs Rajnath Singh asserted that the demonetization has broken the backbone of terror and Maoist funding. Union Minister for law Ravi Shankar Prasad said that the decision on demonetization has given a blow to the black money, besides destroying the network of counterfeit currencies.
Union Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said that the Congress is indulging in fear-mongering on demonetisation. She stated that a government cannot take anti-people step and then go back to them for votes. “People might be facing some problems due to shortage of small denomination currency notes. Yet, they are supporting Prime Minister Narendra Modi,” she said.
The minister stated that the government is alert on the inconveniences caused to the people on the rollout of demonetization, with Finance Minister Arun Jaitley reviewing the situation every day and responding to the feedback.

LUCKNOW: Calling the Centre’s move to demonetize high value currency notes a hogwash, a big scandal and black emergency, West Bengal Chief Minister and Trinamool Congress president Mamata Banerjee accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi of helping his capitalist friends and business tycoons by thrusting the it upon the people.
Addressing a small gathering in Lucknow on Tuesday, Mamata exhorted the people of poll-bound state to give a befitting reply to Modi’s “notebandi with ‘votebandi’. She blamed the Prime Minister for pushing the people of the country, especially, the poor, farmer, deprived and downtrodden to pain and agony in the name of demonetization.
“Markets, farms, business establishments, shops are closed. People are suffering day in and day out in dearth of cash,” she said. Launching a broadside on Modi, the TMC chief accused the PM of
robbing the people off their hard-earned money by scrapping the high-value currency notes. Reminding him of his poll promise, Mamata said: “He has not been able to bring back the black money stashed abroad but has snatched away peoples’ money slyly by demonetizing the high value notes.”
Comparing Modi with Mohammad-bin-Tuglaq, Banerjee charged him with infringing the constitutional right of the people of the country.  "Country will not be run as per the whims of one individual...he (Modi) is forcing things on people and this had not happened even during the dark days of Emergency," thundered the Trinamool Congress chief in her inimitable style.
The West Bengal Chief Minister asked Narendra Modi to lead by example and make the details of his bank accounts public before seeking the details of BJP MPs and MLAs. She also accused the senior BJP leaders of making huge property purchases just ahead of currency scrapping.
Addressing the meeting jointly with Samajwadi Party, Banerjee asked the Centre to repeal the move saying and vowed to continue her fight against the currency scrapping till it was reviewed. “Had I been in Prime Minister’s place, I would have rolled back the decision and apologised to the people of the country for this whimsical move which is making them suffer day in and day out,” she said.
Ridiculing the PM’s idea of bringing in cashless transactions, Banerjee wondered how could it be possible when 39,000 villages of the state like Uttar Pradesh, she claimed, had nearly no accessibility to banks.
Banerjee expressed her gratitude to Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav for helping her with arrangements, however, the Chief Minister was not present in the meeting. He was represented by his two
ministers— Pawan Pandey and Arvind Singh Gope – who had come with his message to the people.
Later, SP national vice president and Rajya Sabha MP Kiranmoy Nanda reiterated his party’s support to Mamata on the issue. "People of the state will undertake surgical strikes in  the coming elections on the BJP which raised hue and cry over  surgical strikes after going back on its promise of bringing back black money from foreign accounts," Nanda said.

With demonetisation fires breaking out all over, how to keep track of it all? Here's how:
 
BJP vote share increased in Bengal bypolls
 
KOLKATA: After winning all the bypolls in West Bengal earlier this week, -- one Assembly and two Lok Sabha seats -- Mamata Banerjee has been crowing that Narendra Modi's gambit has been rebuffed by her state's voters.
But returns from the three byelections show that the BJP's vote share increased significantly since the previous polls. Mamata Banerjee's Trinamool Congress (TMC) won the Coochbehar and Tamluk Lok Sabha seats by a nearly five lakh votes and the Monteswar Assembly seat by 1.27 lakh votes. However, the BJP's vote share in the Coochbehar LS seat rose from 16.4 per cent to 28.5 per cent and in  Tamluk LS seat from 6.4 per cent to 15.25 per cent. However, the party lost its security deposit in the Monteswar Assembly seat, though.

NEW DELHI: Amidst political slugfest over demonetization of high value currency, the BJP on Friday sought to take high ground on the issue of black money, while asking the Opposition parties to clarify their positions. Claiming that the Opposition has been rattled over the decision of demonetization, the BJP chief Amit Shah stated that “some political parties have become poorer”.
The BJP chief challenged the Opposition to contest the upcoming state elections on the issue of black money. “Let the people decide which party is against black money,” said Shah, while adding that the Opposition parties always questioned the Narendra Modi-led NDA government on steps being taken against black money. “Now that the government unveiled strongest measures against black money, these parties are rattled,” claimed Shah.
The BJP chief also refuted the claims that the ruling party knew in advance about the impending government decision. “only constitutional authorities and those in the administration knew of the upcoming decision. The BJP has no illicit money. We submit our accounts with the Election Commission," added the BJP chief.
In line with the strategy of the BJP and the NDA government at the Centre to fire-fight the apparent anger among the people inconvenienced by the measure, Shah sought to counter the charges of the Congress, Samajwadi Party, BSP and Trinamool Congress by claiming that only non-tax payers and those with ill-gotten money are anguished with the decision to demonetize. 
While the Finance Minister Arun Jaitely will reportedly give as many as 80 interviews to the television channels, other Union Ministers, besides the BJP leaders, would be reaching out to the media to give clarifications and messages that the economy would get a major boost following the demonetization.
“The Opposition parties have exposed themselves and shown their true face by criticising the government’s bold decision. They have been rattled. Some political parties have become poorer as well,” said Shah during a press briefing at the party headquarter.
The BJP chief wondered why Congress, SP, BSP and AAP are so “pained”. “I can understand that dealers of black money, fake currency, hawala and drug, besides naxalites are rattled. But I cannot understand why leaders like Mulayam Singh Yadav, Mayawati and Arvind Kejriwal are joining the unhappy lot,” quipped Shah.
In a bid to reach out to the people who have been inconvenienced due to the demonetization decision, Shah stated that the “all patriots, the common man, tax payers do not need to worry and the government will protect the interests of the poor, farmers, labourers, small traders”.

Last month on this date, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced his battle against black money on national television by demonetising, in one fell swoop, all Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes. Life as they knew it changed for Indians all over the country as they went scurrying around in confusion to exchange their old Rs. 500 and Rs. 1000 notes. As a month passed since then, a lot has been said and done on the issue, but unfortunately, the situation still remains same in many parts of the country. 
Even in all this, the select few people who have access to the internet have been able to joke about their situation, dedicated and hard-working meme makers and a few witty good samaritans who shared them, supplied netizens with an abundant quantity of jokes and trolls to keep themselves entertained and forget the woes of demonetisation even as they readjusted to the new way of life using online banking and plastic money.
To mark one month since demonetisation, here's a carefully curated collection of the best memes and tweets that sum up the internet-savvy citizens' minds since the move. Mitron, here it is, for your viewing pleasure - 12 memes that sum up demonetisation. 
1. Football teams, are you listening? 
 
2. Not sure what was more 'mushkil', the actual movie or the ATM queues. 

3. Could there be a better meme on this?

4. Phew, watch out ladies, there's too much swag in this one!

5. The internet went wild when someone wrote 'Sonam Gupta bewafa hai' (Sonam Gupta is disloyal) on one of the new Rs. 2000 notes. It certainly didn't take long for wild conspiracy theories to shoot up. 
 
6. Who can forget Rahul Gandhi's Twitter account getting hacked?
 
7. People's social skills were greatly tested during this phase. 
 
8. This is how you win the internet, people. 
 
9. ...he actually nailed it. 
 
10. And that's how karma works, ladies and gentlemen. 

11. Twitter might just have more parody accounts than actual users. 
 
12. Rs. 100 note: I would like to thank Modi ji for this incredible opportunity to let me help the society. 
 
Memes or no memes, demonetisation has certainly affected all of us. Until the situation gets better, lets hope the meme mills keep running.

In a letter published in andhraheadlines.com, a common man has written an open letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, questioning him why the public should diligently pay taxes and also face the inconvenience caused due to demonetisation.  The open letter has gone viral on social media and is being shared widely, in what may be an addition to the criticism that the Centre is now facing.
Below is the full text of the open letter that was published on the website:
Dear Prime Minister Narendra Modi sir,
Namaste,
My name is Prasad. I have a small industry in Balanagar Hyderabad. My industry turn over is about 2 lakhs per month. This means per year it is 24 lakhs. Honestly and truthfully with all the exemptions I should be paying about 3 lakhs Income Tax to Government. But I just pay 30,000. Why?
I was born in a middle class family and with hard work and studies I came up well. Initially, I did some job for a living but after saving every paisa I have grown to the level of having my own start up industry. About 1 lakh is enough to take care of my family's needs and other 1 lakh I invest (either in gold or shares or buying lands).
In the one lakh I spend for family, about 30000 is going indirectly in some form or the other to the government. From groceries to TV to mobile I am paying 20 to 30% of spending in tax only. If I enjoy a small party and spend Rs 3000 on drinks about 60% is going as tax to government.
Even for a liter of petrol I am having pumped about 30 rupees is going to government as tax. When I bought the car, in form of taxes alone I paid about Rs 1.5 lakhs. For a plot, I paid 1 lakh as registration fee. The colony I am residing does not even have a road of any standard and hence I paid Rs 50,000 as development fee.
After seeing the plight of patients in government hospitals and knowing well the looting nature of private hospitals, I took a health insurance policy for my family members and shamelessly even on that I am charged a service tax.
Like robbers every where I am taxed. Even in graveyards government is taxing people. But is what is this government doing to us in return?
Do we have confidence that our children will learn anything if joined in a government school? Are we assured to come home alive if we go to a government hospital? Other than country's defence and laying roads we are not understanding where the developments works are going. Buy a car, there is road tax, get on road there is toll tax. Are we not ripped off sir?
Where is the money we are paying in taxes sir? If I have to raise salary of the employees in my industry I appraise their work and give an increment. But what are the governments doing? Even if a government employee works or not they get the same salary and same increment. Why is it that our money is so cheap, sir? On top of it taking our tax money as salaries people don't do our work. If office is at 10 people come at 11 and wont move a pin without bribe. So, tell us sir, why should we pay taxes? If my industry has to get uninterrupted power I need to pay bribe. In all I pay around Rs 10000 as bribe per month. How can I show this bribe in white, SIR??
Simply for this reason we hate to pay tax to governments sir. That does not mean I have no social responsibility, sir. I gave 10000 when you have appealed to help for the army fund. I give 20000 a year to an orphanage in my neighbourhood and gave a donation of 1 lakh in the name of my father when people of my village said they will uplift the school. But sorry, I don't have same heart to pay tax to government, Sir!
Anyway, this is past. Now we will see everything in white. Since you have taken the call, I will pay 30% tax in the 10 lakhs I have and change it to white. But can you guarantee me that I don't have to pay the 10000 bribe I need to every month? Or will you permit people to take bribes too in the form of cheques? 
And I did not talk about leaders...from street leader to MLA for all the elections for all the parties I should give funds. If not I am doomed. Will you bring an act to such people to accept funds in the form of cheques? Will the party funds be revealed to public?
Already we are paying so many taxes and tell us how is the government serving us. We wont pay taxes for the luxurious life of politicians or for salaries of government employees sir. We will try to not pay as much possible.
In another 10 years the country will see again a huge rise of black money. Will there be demonetization even then? This is not why we have elected you sir. Win our trust, do justice for the taxes we are paying first, then people will repose faith in the governments. We are ready to support you, and waiting to see you act!
Your
Fan, and a voter

NEW DELHI: The Prime Minister of India Narendra Modi on Tuesday, termed the demonetisation as the beginning of government efforts to curb black money. Finance Minister Arun Jaitley also said that the demonetisation would help India to embrace digital economy.
Speaking at Parliamentary Board meeting of the BJP, the Prime Minister noted that more than Rs 5 lakh crore has already come into the banking system. 
"Demonetisation is the only beginning of government effort to cleanse the system of black money and corruption. In the coming times more steps will be taken against black money," said Modi.
The meeting attended by the BJP MPs of both the Houses came at a time when Parliament stands paralysed over the issue of demonetization. 
Apparently seeking to rally support for the decision on demonetization, the top brass of the NDA government sought to send a strong message that the move would give huge tangible benefits to the people at large. "Demonetisation will help us achieve an honest economy and help improve the lots of the poor," said Modi.
The BJP Parliamentary board has welcomed the decision of the government on banning of old Rs 500 and Rs 1000  currency notes in a resolution passed unanimously in the meeting.
"The decision on demonetization will help people to adopt a digital mode of payments. This will bring the cash component in the economy substantially," said Jaitley, while speaking at the meeting.
The resolution passed at the meeting also claimed that the decision on demonetization has destroyed the terror funding network, besides the counterfeit currencies.

BELAGAVI: Escalating his attack on Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Rahul Gandhi today trashed demonetisation of high-value currency notes as a "Modi-made disaster" and charged that he had attacked the economic system of the country to benefit the one percent "super rich."
"For the first time in the history of India, Prime Minister has attacked the poor people of this country. Usually, the Prime Minister works for the country. They work for the economy, but Narendra Modi has attacked our economic system,"
Gandhi alleged at a Congress rally here in north Karnataka.
"As it is said a man-made disaster, in the same way demonetization is Modi-made disaster," the Congress Vice-President said as he targeted the Prime Minister squarely blaming him for the hardships post-demonetisation.
More than 100 people had died, he claimed, adding, "Fidel Castro (Cuban revolutionary) was remembered in the Parliament and we stood in silence for two minutes as a mark of respect to him, but BJP leaders did not have two minutes time for these hundred people."
"Who is responsible for their deaths? Narendra Modi is responsible....In the last two and half years Narendra Modi government has been attacking the poor," he said.
Accusing the Modi government of trying to divide India, he said on the one side, there were one percent super rich who have private aircraft, flashy vehicles and big businesses and on the other, there were 99 percent of people who are honest like farmers, labourers, small traders and middle class who toil every day for the sake of the country and their lives.
"In the last two and half years, one per cent super-rich in this country have amassed 70 per cent of India's wealth and if you look deep into this one per cent, only 50 families have a major portion of India's wealth."
"You know their names; these are the people who travel with Narendra Modi to America, Japan, and Australia," Gandhi said.
"Congress wants to get rid of corruption from India and whatever step the BJP government takes whether it is big or small if it is against corruption we will give it full support," he said.
Asserting that demonetization was not against the rich but against the poor, middle class, farmers, labourers and small traders, Gandhi said "all black money is not cash, and all cash is not black money."
"Who has black money, it is with those 50 families, and it is with one per cent super rich in this country..," he said.
"...All the black money is not in cash, India's thieves are clever, and as soon as they get the money they invest it in a land, real estate, gold or in foreign bank accounts like Swiss bank."
According to government figures, he said six per cent of the black money is in cash, 94 percent in real estate, big buildings and in foreign bank accounts.
Claiming that the Swiss government had given a list of Swiss bank account holders' names to the Indian government, he said the Congress had been asking the government to table the names of "these thieves" in the Parliament for the last two and half years."Why is it not being tabled? Why is Modi protecting them?"
"Why are Lalit Modi and Vijay Mallya sitting in London?
Why are they not in India? Why didn't you get them back?
"Vijay Mallya is India's thief. After demonetization why did you waive Rs 1200 crore loan of this man? Answer me why did you feed him a toffee of Rs 1200 crore?"
Gandhi said Modi knows that most part of the black money is in the Swiss bank, real estate and in huge buildings, "but I don't know for what reason instead of going after 94 percent black money, he is after the six per cent. Instead of going after one per cent super-rich he is behind 99 percent."
"He is not after thieves, but behind poor farmers, labourers," Gandhi said.

KOLKATA: Claiming that people have been subjected to harassment and financial insecurity in the one month since demonetization, West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee today said the Prime Minister must clarify the situation to the nation and take entire responsibility for it.
    
She also claimed that 90 people have died due to hardships following demonetization of high-value notes.
    
"One month of harassment, pain, hopelessness, financial insecurity and utter chaos," Banerjee said in a statement.
    
"That is all that the common people has got after the black decision on demonetization announced a month back on November eight," Banerjee, who has been the most vocal against demonetization of high-value notes, said.
    
"PM must clarify the situation to the nation and take entire responsibility," Banerjee said.
    
Claiming that no black money has been recovered, the Trinamool Congress supremo said, "Only white money of the common people has been snatched away."
    
The TMC MPs have been staging protests in both houses of Parliament since the winter session began.
    
"Even no black money has been recovered from foreign countries. In the name of recovery of so-called black money, the ruling party at the Centre has created assets in the form of land, bank deposits, gold, diamonds and has become more and more capitalist," Banerjee, who has led an unrelenting attack on the BJP and Prime Minister Narendra Modi over demonetization, said. 
"One month since demonetization was announced. More than 90 lives lost. How many more Modi babu?" Banerjee said on twitter.
    
She said in her statement, "Production has nosedived, agricultural activities have been shattered, buying and selling is down drastically, the economy is in shambles - the entire country is passing through an unprecedented financial emergency.
    
"Untold sufferings have come down in the lives of farmers, labourers, workers of unorganised sectors, tea garden, beedi and jute workers, employed class, students, sick, old and infirm people," the chief minister said in her statement.
    
"The common man is helpless. Mothers and sisters have been forced to give away their small personal savings to run the family in the face of a serious cash crunch."
    
"No one knows when this unfortunate ordeal will end. No one knows when good senses will prevail to stop this mindless harassment and sufferings of common people. No one knows what good has happened to the country and its people with this big, black decision," the chief minister said.
     
Calling for immediate action to restore trust and confidence of the people on banking and financial sectors, Banerjee said, "People must have hassle-free access to their own money and feel secure that their money is safe with banks and financial institutions."
    
"We have raised the issue repeatedly in Parliament and in different other platforms. Leading economists have criticised this mindless demonetization. But there is no response yet," she added.

VELLORE: Getting into the nitty-gritty of political decisions over a hot cup of tea at the ubiquitous stalls is a favourite pastime in the life of an average Tamil citizen. However, a raging debate over a cup of tea on the Centre’s demonetization drive took an awry turn recently at Ambur, where two persons assaulted a speaker backing the decision.
The drama unfolded at Sanror Kuppam in Ambur on November 13, when two daily wage labourers – P Silambarasan and Paranthaman – were discussing Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s demonetization decision at Senthil Tea Stall. The two persons were reportedly fuming at the decision, which had rendered them unable to withdraw their own money from ATMs.
Even as the discussion was going on, G Gopinathan (40) and his friend Kumaran walked into the shop to recharge their mobile numbers. Hearing Silambarasan using foul language to sum up the decision, which had caused a lot of hardship to poor labourers, Gopinathan raised strong objections. Gopinathan claimed that the decision was a right step in getting rid of black money and ushering in development. During the debate, Gopinathan allegedly made a sarcastic remark about Silambarasan and Paranthaman.
The labourer duo soon began putting forth their view, but the heated debate soon turned into an argument, said Ambur Town police inspector Selvaraj. Soon, the matter snowballed into fisticuffs, with Silambarasan and Paranthaman beating up Gopinathan. The duo allegedly pushed Gopinathan down and kicked him in the face. “There was no previous enmity between them. The duo went into hiding for the past few days,” the official added.
While the mud slinging and praise showering are taken with a pinch of salt during long-winded heated arguments over a cuppa, the assault invited a case under sections 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 502 (II) (criminal intimidation) and 294 (b)(abusing with foul language) against the duo, the official said.
I-T search at jewellery shops
Vellore: Officials of income tax department inspected three jewellery shops in Tiruvannamalai on Tuesday evening. “Officials seized unaccounted cash from the jewellers, including lakhs of scrapped D1,000 and D500 notes,” said official sources. The inspection lasted for about five to six hours.

NEW DELHI: Accusing Rahul Gandhi of levelling baseless allegations against the government to grab headlines, BJP today dared him to speak on demonetization in Parliament.
    
Attacking the Congress Vice President, the ruling party said on the one hand he claims to speak about the interests of the common man but on the other hand Congress was stalling Parliament for three weeks and wasting public money spent on running it.
    
Congress ran way from discussion in Parliament when it was in power and it is doing the same now when it is in the opposition, BJP National Secretary Shrikant Sharma alleged.
    
"His (Rahul's) charges against the Modi government are borne out of his incompetence and arrogance. He is competing with Arvind Kejriwal in TRP politics by levelling baseless charges on almost daily basis. He is doing so merely for headlines. He should instead speak in Parliament not outside," Sharma said.
    
He was reacting after Rahul attacked Prime Minister Narendra Modi, saying his "foolish decision", a reference to demonetization, has "devastated" the country.
    
Earlier also, the Congress leader had targeted Modi over demonetization, accusing him of practising TRP politics and said the country has suffered damage due to his "vanity and incompetence".
    
Sharma hit out at Rahul, saying he was rattled by Modi's offensive against black money and corruption as they are rooted in the opposition party's culture and said the Congress leader's allegations highlight his "mental bankruptcy".
    
Congress does not want Modi to take developmental measures for the poor and farmers, he said, adding that the Prime Minister's fight is not against some political parties or persons but against corruption.
    
"When 2G, coal block allocation and CWG scams happened during the UPA government, BJP wanted debate in Parliament but Congress ran away from it. It continues to avoid a debate even in opposition. It committed scams worth 12 lakh crore and is rattled by the Modi government's actions," he claimed.

NEW DELHI: The Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday told the parliamentary Board meeting of the BJP that the decision on demonetization is just the beginning of a long battle against black money and corruption. The Parliamentary Board of the BJP in a resolution endorsed the Prime Minister’s “crusade” against black money and corruption.
The Prime Minister during his first speech to the BJP MPs in the ongoing Winter session of Parliament got emotional, saying that his decisions are not for personal gains but for benefit of the people. The BJP leaders afterwards explained that the Prime Minister had been peeved at personal attacks by the MPs of the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha in the Parliament on the agitation against demonetization.
"We have come to power not for personal benefits or toi benefit those who we know, but for the poor. The common men suffered for 70 years on account of black money, corruption and terrorism,” Modi said. The Prime Minister also stated that his government would not waver from the path to eliminate black money. He recalled that the government had also taken a few measures, including setting up of a SIT on black money and Income Disclosure Scheme, 2016.
“Demonetisation is not the end but beginning of a long, deep and constant battle against black money and corruption. It will benefit the poor and the common man. The poor and the lower and middle classes have suffered the most due to black money, counterfeit currency and corruption,” said Modi.
The BJP MPs gave standing ovation to the Prime Minister, while slogans were reportedly raised to hail the decision on demonetization. Modi stated that the economy would come out much stronger after the implementation of the decision on demonetisation.
Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitely told the BJP MPs that the demonetisation would help India embrace digital economy.

NEW DELHI: Aam Aadmi party led Delhi government on Tuesday gave a political start to first session of the year of Delhi assembly. Delhi government started the session by paying homage to people died during demonetization while standing in bank queues. Apart from this, assembly also observed two minutes silence on the sad demise of former CM of Tamil Nadu Jayalalithaa. Just after this, MLAs of Aam Aadmi party also brought to the fore a discussion on ex Delhi LG Najeeb Jung, However, it was ruled out by the speaker.
Following this, AAP Minister Satyendar Jain also attacked union government and termed the DDA as Delhi ‘Destruction Authority.’ “We want limited share of the land. The government would not commercialize it but set up facilities like schools and fire stations. We don't want concrete jungles. But DDA is not responding...DDA is not a development authority but a destruction authority,” Jain, the Delhi health minister, said.
Meanwhile, Leader of Opposition in Delhi Assembly Vijender Gupta termed the session as “illegal”. Gupta said by not inviting the new Lt Governor Anil Baijal to address the “first session of the year”, the government has “violated and misused” rules. To which, Goel reprimanded Gupta for “dragging” the new LG who is “good and gentle”. The BJP MLA also questioned the intent of the government
in stretching the fourth session of the Assembly over six segments. “It is contradictory that you are conducting monsoon session in winter,” he said. However, both Goel and Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia rejected Gupta's charges. This is the sixth segment of the ongoing fourth session of the Assembly.

BENGALURU: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is expected to cut interest rates next week and economists are set to chop growth and inflation forecasts after Prime Minister Narendra Modi's currency crackdown rattled the economy and severely hurt consumption, a Reuters poll showed.
Modi's outlawing of high-value bank notes last month, aimed at curbing corruption and tax evasion, has left the nation's 1.2 billion population scrambling to exchange old notes for new and left many companies' cash-reliant supply chains in tatters.
India's economy expanded 7.3 percent in the July-September quarter from a year earlier, making it the fastest growing major country in the world. But it could easily lose top spot if some of the more pessimistic views that suggest growth could halve post-demonetization come true.
It could also drag inflation down. At 4.2 percent in October, it is below the central bank's early-2018 target of 5 percent.
The median forecast in the poll of nearly 60 economists this week was that the RBI's recently formed Monetary Policy Committee will cut the repo rate by 25 basis points (bps) to 6.00 percent when it concludes its two-day meeting on Dec. 7 from 6.25 percent now.
Two-thirds of the respondents expected a cut, with 31 of 56 respondents expecting it to be 25 bps, while six predicted a deeper 50 bps reduction. One said the RBI would slash rates by 75 bps.
"Given the concerns about demonetization and the slowdown it is likely to generate in sectors that have traditionally been cash dependant, such as consumption goods, the RBI will try to cushion the blow with a rate cut," said Shilan Shah of Capital Economics in Singapore.
Still, 18 analysts forecast no move next week. Only four of them were based in India, suggesting domestic banks and research houses closer to the real impact from the policy generally held a more negative view on the effects of demonetization.
Consumer spending accounts for over half of India's output and the overnight withdrawal of 86 percent of the currency in circulation has left farmers, households and even companies struggling to meet their daily needs.
The rupee has weakened some 3 percent in recent weeks to record lows. although a Reuters poll this week showed it is unlikely to continue falling.
The deluge of cash pouring into banks has resulted in excess liquidity, which the RBI tried to mop up with a temporary hike to its reserve requirements last week. The poll found the cash reserve ratio will be kept unchanged at 4 percent in December.
The reverse repo rate, which moves in tandem with the main lending rate and is the interest the RBI pays to soak up funds, is expected to be cut to 5.50 percent from 5.75 percent.
After next week, the consensus is that a final 25 bps rate cut will come in the April-June quarter.
The RBI has chopped rates by 175 bps since January 2015 on a global disinflation trend from lower energy prices and slowing growth.
"With the banking system flush with liquidity, monetary policy transmission should be better in the months ahead. We expect the RBI to use the potential impact of demonetization as a rationale for further rate cuts," said Kaushik Basu, economist at Deutsche Bank in Mumbai.
While there is no clear indication on how much of a hit growth is likely to take as a result of Modi's demonetization drive, economists are certain it won't be minor.
All but one of the 29 respondents to a separate question in the survey said they would be downgrading near-term growth forecasts as a result of demonetization. The vast majority of them also said the outlook for inflation would be lowered.
Analysts generally agree that under the newly-formed Monetary Policy Committee chaired by Urjit Patel, the RBI's stance has drifted somewhat away from former Governor Raguhuram Rajan's priority on inflation towards underpinning growth.
"The RBI put its credibility on the line by cutting rates the last time in October when there were still concerns that it wouldn't meet its inflation target," said Shah of Capital Economics, adding: "that is a clear departure from how monetary policy was run under the previous governor Raghuram Rajan."

VIJAYAWADA: With the limitation on withdrawals at ATMs and majority of the ATMs displaying ‘No Cash’ boards, the queues at banks in the city for withdrawal of money is increasing by each passing day.
Queues for withdrawal are getting longer and longer than those for a cash deposit. The people are spending hours together in the queues for their transactions. At the Lakshmipuram branch of Andhra Bank in the city, people were waiting patiently for the bank to open post lunch on Monday. Once the doors opened, they dashed inside and waited for another half-hour for the counters to become functional. Soon, there wasn’t enough space even to stand for about 15 minutes in the bank.
The ATM kiosk near the bank had no public as there was no cash. Cash deposit machines, however, were functioning unlike in the first week of demonetization.
The situation was no different in Srinagar branch of the SBI. There was a long queue for withdrawals and a young teacher, who wished to remain anonymous, said she has been waiting for several hours to get money. “The ATMs are not working for most of the time and even when they work, the amount one can withdraw is small. Hence, I thought it better to withdraw cash from the bank itself,” she said.
Prabhakar Naidu, a private employee, had to come out disappointed from the SBI Suryaraopet branch as the cash dispensing stopped just when his turn came in the queue. “It appears they do not have enough Rs 100 notes. So they are trying to issue Rs 2,000 notes,” he said.
However, the customers do not seem to prefer Rs 2000 notes as getting the small change is becoming increasingly difficult. He said there appears to be a shortage of small denomination notes. A bank manager, who refused to be identified, concurred with the observations.
It is learnt that none of the banks in Vijayawada has received new Rs 500 currency so far despite reports that the Rs 500 currency has reached the state.

VIJAYAWADA: When the Prime Minister announced his demonetization decision on November 8, middleaged farmer Varre Venkateswarlu thought he was lucky. He had ventured into aquaculture just a month ago, converting his two-and-ahalf acre paddy field into an aquaculture pond to cultivate shrimp. “Just two days after I paid cash for the shrimp seed, the government announced demonetization. Initially, I felt lucky that I beat the government to it, but now I am worried. I need cash to buy other
inputs,” he says. Venkateswarlu, though assured of credit to buy feed for his shrimp, is concerned about other expenses like fuel for the motor pump, medicines and lab expenses for getting the prawns tested for diseases. It’s a situation of uncertainty in an uncertain industry. Venkateshwarlu’s farm falls in the hinterland of Bhimavaram, the aquaculture capital of Andhra Pradesh. There are 200 acres of aqua farms in his village of Pamulaparru in Undi mandal of West Godavari district.
Another 200 fallow acres are ready for conversion, the farmers hoping like Venkateshwarlu for a bonanza in raising shrimp. But the whole economy of the village is in stasis post-demonetization.
“Labourers have to be paid in cash and I don’t have it. So my son and I are doing all the work. I don’t know what will happen next,” Venkateswarlu says, sounding doubtful about his gamble. Many fingers are crossed in this part of Andhra Pradesh with first-time farmers hoping that the cash crunch will end by the time they have to buy the seed for the February crop. The sentiment is echoed by most of the aqua farmers who sowed in October- November. Those preparing for harvest, like M Srinivas Rao of Pali village in Bhimavaram mandal, are the most anxious, as the need for cash gets more pressing each passing day. Many of them are on the edge of panic for the shrimp have to be harvested in just about 10 days. This in short is how demonetisation has cast a shadow over aquaculture in Andhra Pradesh, the largest producer and exporterof seafood, particularly shrimp, in the country. Around 3.5 lakh farmers and near about 20 lakh workers are dependent on aquaculture in the state. Be it a smalltime prawn farmer in Nellore or a big-fish farmer in Bhimavaram or a seafood exporter in Visakhapatnam, all are feeling the heat of demonetisation be it due to the curbs on withdrawal of money from banks and possible tax burden they have to face.
With not enough liquid cash inm hand, owners are either postponing or making part-payments. “Initially, they gave us `1,000 and `500 notes. We had to take leave to deposit the notes. Now, we are due to be paid again, but the owners say they do not have the cash and ask us to wait for some more time,” says K Ravi Kumar, a supervisor in a fish packing factory in Mahadevapatnam near Bhimavaram.
Chinna Rao, a worker in another packing unit, has run out of cash. “I have to take care of my old parents. Though my parents get pension, withdrawing it has become a laborious task,” he says, adding that even getting credit has become difficult. K Ramakrishna Raju, a fish farmer, on the other hand has a different problem. He has money but it is locked up in transactions and the curbs on bank withdrawals are costing him. “The situation is grim. On an average, 200 truckloads of fish
leave the state per day with each truck load valued at around `10 lakh. Post-demonetisation, the number has come down to 50-60 trucks. If the situation does not improve in the next two weeks, it will be tough,” Gadhiraju Subbaraju, president of the Coastal Aqua Fish Farmers Welfare Association,
explained.
Another crucial factor at play in the aquaculture sector in Andhra Pradesh is the very nature of the financial transactions. Most of them are carried out through the non-banking sector. Many farmers have no bank accounts. “Making payments to them has become hard. We are ready to switch to cashless transactions,but without bank accounts, it is not possible,” points out B Mastan Rao, an agent in Nellore.
Aqua farmers are in fact worried about depositing their money in banks as they do not maintain books. If the large amounts get deposited in the form of payment
for their crop in banks, they fear that the taxman will come after them. Since the amount runs into lakhs of rupees, the tax will be heavy. “We have to make payments and if we pay tax for the entire amount, we will be left without anything to clear our dues,” says V S Murthy, a prawn
farmer in Undi.
A higher official dealing with seafood exports said it is time for bankers to take pro-active measures to deal with the situation. Exporters on the other hand say demonetisation has little impact on exports, but are wary of the future. But one thing seems certain. Production will come down by 35-40 per cent, says V Satyanarayna Raju, AP Prawn Farmers’ Association president

NEW DELHI: Even while the Parliament remained in a gridlock for eight days in a row, the government is expecting a breakthrough in the impasse soon, with Prime Minister Narendra Modi likely to attend the proceedings of the Lok Sabha on Tuesday. NDA floor managers and a section of the Opposition claimed that the key to unlock the Parliamentary gridlock lies with the Lok Sabha, and a long speech of the Congress vice president Rahul Gandhi through an intervention is on the card.
Proceedings of both the Houses of the Parliament were marred with ruckus even while the Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitely introduced “The Taxation Laws (Second Amendment) Bill, 2016” at 2 pm amidst pandemonium in the Lok Sabha, which seeks to tax the undisclosed amounts through “Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Deposit Scheme”. After repeated adjournments, both the Houses were adjourned for the day.
“The Aakrosh Diwas (protest day) is now over. The Opposition has got the measure of their street power on the issue of demonetization. They want Rahul Gandhi to make a long speech in the Lok Sabha. The Prime Minister will also make an intervention and thereby explain the reasons behind the decision on demonetization. The deadlock in the Parliament will last only a few days more,” sources in the government said.
The Congress and the Trinamool Congress leaders have also been learnt to have held parleys and discussed ways to “climb down” for the obstructionist position. “The government will not agree with debate on demonetization under Rule 56 with adjournment and voting. The BJD floor leader in the Lok Sabha Bhartruhari Mahatab has shown the way by suggesting that the debate could be held under the Rule 184 with voting but without an adjournment. Mahatab’s formula could be the possible way out,” said a senior TMC leader.
Union Minister for Home Affairs Rajnath Singh assured the Lok Sabha that the Prime Minister would speak if the House takes up debate on demonetization. Singh was responding to the common demand of the Congress, TMC and Samajwadi Party for debate under Rule 56 along with the presence of the Prime Minister in the House.
The clear indication of resolution of the impasse came from the floor leader of the TMC in the Lok Sabha Sudip Bandyopadhyay, who argued that the Parliament should resume normal functions, as “what else the House is for”. However, the Opposition members also stated that the onus on resolution of the impasse lied with the government.
Meanwhile, there was a brief normalcy in both the Houses when the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha condoled the death of the Cuban leader Fidel Castro.
Lader of Opposition in the Rajya Sabha Ghulam Nabi Azad and Mallikarjuna Kharge in the Lok Sabha lamented that the demonetization has led to chaos and suffering and people are in deep anguish due to hardship. Both the Houses witnessed the Opposition MPs in the well of the Houses raising slogans against the demonetization and the Prime Minister.

GUWAHATI: Demonetisation sent ripples across the country within minutes of the announcement by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the evening of November 8 but it took three days for the ripples to reach this town on the border with China in Arunachal Pradesh.
Except for staff of the lone SBI branch here and perhaps a few officials in the administration and some defence personnel, nobody had a whiff of what the Prime Minister announced for two days and business went on as usual.
Perched at an altitude of 6,200 feet 29 km as the crow flies from the Tibetan border, Mechukha is a sub-division in West Siang district of Arunachal Pradesh. It has 160 villages with a population of 13,200. The nearest Indian town from Mechukha is the district headquarters of Aalo, which is 190 km downhill. The state capital Itanagar is 492 km away. There is an airstrip here, built years ago for the defence forces, which is used by the private helicopter service provider Skyone Airways to ferry passengers at times. The solitary road, built a decade ago, that connects Mechukha to Aalo is as good as non-existent.
There is no ATM in the town. So the only place people could have gone to upon learning of the demonetization of big notes was the SBI branch here. Nobody knew about the countrywide closure of banks on November 9 and 10 and so there was no rush of customers to exchange their Rs 500 and Rs 1000 currency notes. It was only on November 11 that news filtered in and people made a beeline to the SBI branch.
For most people the import of the news came from people they knew in Guwahati. But then only BSNL works here and the lines are down almost the whole day. On the day the Prime Minister made his announcement, Mechukha went to sleep innocent of the decision. The few people who knew of the demonetization had no trouble using their high-value currency notes the next morning.
The situation has changed totally since then, and the economy of the border town has turned topsy turvy. On the telephone from Mechukha, Kesang Goiba, the president of the Mechukha village chieftains committee, told this correspondent that most of the shops and commercial establishments have remained shut for the past three days. "We learnt of it (demonetization) on November 11. Since then, we have been visiting the SBI branch but they are telling us there is no change. We are going through a very difficult time," he said.
Goiba added, "There is no business at all. Most of the shops are closed. We are bartering rations and vegetables with neighbours. We don't know for how long we will have to go through this agony," he said.

MUMBAI: The Shiv Sena’s opposition to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s financial decision making got shriller Wednesday, with an editorial in the regional party’s newspaper Saamna launching a stinging attack on the Central government’s planned initiative against proxy property holding (called benami properties).
The editorial alleged that the move will go the way of the Union government’s demonetization decision, and end up safeguarding the rich while the poor get crushed.
“Modi led a surgical strike against black money.. but the truth is not a penny has been recovered. The rich of the country have incurred not even a dime’s loss after the demonetisation decision but the common man has been harried,” the editorial said.
“Now what does the government plan to do against benami properties? We hope that the middle class citizens are not crushed under the harsh steps taken by the government like what happened after demonetisation. Hope that the real benami property holders do not legalize their properties while the common man is stripped naked,” it said. 
Once an announcement on benami properties is made, those possessing proxy-held estates will convert all of it into legal holdings within 24 hours, like the hundreds of crores of rupees converted into laundered money after demonetization, the editorial added.
The Shiv Sena mouthpiece suggested the government was better advised to do something to restore the properties of Kashmiri Hindus who have abandoned their lands due to terrorism in Kashmir.

NEW DELHI: Hitting out at the central government’s demonetisation scheme, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Tuesday accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi of using his mother for political gains and protecting his friends in the corporate world.
The day-long special assembly session was convened to discuss the issue. “While the common man is lectured about patriotism, Reddy has spent Rs 500 crore on wedding as per reports. Vijay Mallya who has Rs 8,000 crore debt was allowed to flee by BJP. Rs 1.14 lakh crore of big corporate loan was waived. They take money from the rich and force people to queue up outside banks. In the name of strong tea, you have fed them poison” said Kejriwal addressing the house. The Chief Minister also met the Chief Minister of West Bengal Mamata Banarjee at her house in Delhi to talk about banning of the big currency notes.  
The Delhi Assembly also passed a resolution urging President Pranab Mukherjee to refer the allegations of receipt of bribes by persons "holding high offices from Birla and Sahara Groups to Supreme Court of India with the request to order suitable inquiry".
Kejriwal also wondered whether Modi would follow BJP patriarch LK Advani's example, who had "set a precedent" by resigning when his "initials LKA" had surfaced in the hawala scam.
"Congress did not take action against 648 Swiss bank account holders, even Modiji did not even write to the Swiss government. That list has the names of PM's friends, Panama list includes his friends' name," he alleged.
“CM has charged the Central government of leaking information to BJP leaders. If there is any evidence to this then he should file a FIR. It is an act of cowardice on Kejriwal’s part. His only aim is to derail the PM’s momentum against black money” said BJP leader Vijender Gupta.

NEW DELHI: Before the Rajya Sabha was adjourned for the day due to lack of quorum, opposition party members continued their attack on the government over demonetisation on Friday too. Now the House will meet on December 14.
Amidst protests on demonetization, angry opposition protested government's move to slash import duty on wheat from 10 per cent to zero. They alleged that this was meany to benefit multinational firms. This led to adjournment of the House till noon after the House proceedings for the day started at 11 am.

Opposition members from Congress, SP, BSP, JD (U), left amongst other members alleged that the government’s decision to slash import duty on wheat from 10 per cent to zero will hit the farmer hard as the country already has enough buffer stock. The move ahead of the winter wheat crop will help MNCs to dump cheap wheat from US, France and Ukraine in the country, they said.
However, reacting to opposition claims, food minister Ram Vilas Paswan said there was no shortage of wheat in the country and the decision was taken to cool down domestic prices which has shown an upward trend in recent weeks. Paswan said wheat prices are on the rise in last few days. This is not a permanent decision, he pointed out.
Raising the issue, CPI(M) leader Sitaram Yechury said he had given a notice under rule 267 to suspend business of the day to discuss the decision that will ruin Indian farmers while MNCs will rake in super-profits. He said the farmers are already hit hard by demonetisation as they are unable to buy seeds and fertiliser due to cash shortage.
Minister of State for Parliamentary Affairs Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi said "unfortunately the opposition members are not allowing the House to function. The President also appealed to members to do their job by allowing the House to function. They should be ashamed of themselves and take his advise to allow important issues to be discussed."
As enough number of members did not assemble even after ringing of the bell twice, Kurien adjourned the House for the day, within minutes of its recovening, citing lack of quorum. As per the rules, at least 10 per cent of the total strenght of the House is required to be present for quorum. In the case of 245-member Rajya Sabha, the quorum number is 25.

PATNA: The ban on currency notes of Rs 500 and Rs 1000, though supported by Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar, made the ordinary people in the state face several difficulties on Wednesday as a number of hospitals refused to accept these currency notes and fuel stations refused to sell fuel for prices less than Rs 500 or Rs 1,000.
“I welcome and support this decision,” said Kumar, who is also the national president of JD(U), about the ban on the currency notes announced by prime minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday evening. 
“People may face some inconvenience in the beginning, but considering everything about it, this decision would produce positive results,” he added.
Kumar’s praise for the demonetization of the two high-value currency notes sprang a surprise as the Bihar CM is known as one of Modi's most outspoken critics.
Deputy chief minister Tejaswi Yadav, however, was not as forthcoming as Kumar in support of the demonetization move. "While this seems useful, the government should put in place elaborate and foolproof mechanism in order to ensure the people do not face hindrances in their routine transactions," said Yadav.
The demonetization drive, while it drew massive public support across Bihar, thousands of people in the state's 38 districts complained of facing trouble as the Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes they had failed to purchase essential goods and services for them.
"Most hospitals in Patna, both private and government, refuse to accept these notes from the people. Medicine shops are simply refusing to sell anything to people carrying notes of the two denominations. It's weird because the government's appeal has been misunderstood by a large section of the trading community," said Manoj Kumar, a BA student in Patna.
An emotionally distressing scene was witnessed in Madhepura district when a young man was turned away by many clothes shops when he approached them with a Rs 500 note to buy a pall for his dead mother before her funeral. The man finally got the new cloth when a generous shopkeeper gifted it to him.
Petrol and fuel refilling stations in Patna and almost all district headquarters towns were reportedly asking people to either buy fuel for "round figures" of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 or return without buying any fuel.

COLOMBO: Sri Lankans, who travel to India in large numbers and frequently, are feeling the pinch after India demonetized 500 and 1000 Indian rupee notes.
Hundreds of thousands of Sri Lankans are stuck with large amounts of Indian currency because they do not change the money while returning to the island from a visit to India. This is because many go back to India for repeat shopping or pilgrimage either to the Buddhist shrines in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh or to the Hindu temples in south India. Multiple visits are normal.  
The problem is huge with over 200,000 Sri Lankans visiting India every year with 120 flights a week connecting Colombo with nine Indian cities. 
Tamils, Sinhalese and Muslims have been making frantic calls to Indian nationals in Sri Lanka and money changers and shop keepers of Indian origin in Colombo’s main market in Pettah, to find out how they can change the notes.
And they are heartbroken when told that there is no way they can change them in Sri Lanka. The Indian banks with branches here like the State Bank of India, have also told them that the there is no way they can help in this matter. They are dismayed when told they should not be having Indian currency in the first place as it is not convertible. 
The only advice that money changers have been giving to their distraught clients is: take the money to India and get it exchanged in a bank or ask a friend to do that. But few consider this a practical option as the deadline of December 30 it too near.

NEW DELHI: The issue of demonetization continued to rock the Parliament with businesses of both the Houses washed out for fourth straight days. Cornering the government, the united Opposition disrupted proceedings of the Parliament.
Changing its strategy in the Rajya Sabha, the Opposition demanded adoption of a condolence resolution for those who died in queues outside banks and ATMs post-demonetisation and pressing for voting on discussion on demonetization under Rule 56 that entails voting.
Soon after condoling the deaths of those killed in Indore-Rajendra Nagar train accident, the Opposition gave a new twist in the Upper House by asserting that no discussion on demonetisation could take place till the House adopts a resolution mourning the death of nearly 70 people claimed to have been caused by hardships after scrapping of the high-denomination notes.
The Lok Sabha also could not function for the third consecutive working day as Opposition parties insisted on taking up of an adjournment motion on demonetisation and a debate under Rule 56 that entails voting.
The Rajya Sabha, which saw a day-long inconclusive debate on demonetisation on the opening day of the Winter session on November 16, has failed to transact any business since then as the Opposition has been demanding a statement from Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
 
In the Upper House, Congress, BSP, TMC and CPI(M)were on the same page pressing for condolence resolution.

Leader of the House and Finance Minister Arun Jaitley accused the Opposition of running away from the demonetisation debate. "Merits and demerits will come out in a debate... Why are they (opposition parties) running away from debate? This is clear now that the opposition is not ready for debate and is coming up with new excuses to disrupt the House," he said amid slogan shouting by Opposition members who were in the well of the House.
Stating that the notice for suspension of business under Rule 267 was accepted on the first day of the winter session and a debate had started, Jaitley said the reported deaths could come up during the course of this debate and the reply to it.
The House was adjourned repeatedly even as the government side, including Minister of State for Parliamentary Affairs Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi, continued to question the opposition's behaviour.

"The sense of the country is against black money. Sense of the country is in favour of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and against those opposing demonetisation," Naqvi said repeatedly in the continuing din, adding that the Opposition is unable to feel the pulse of the people.

As the uproar continued, the House was adjourned for the day at about 3 PM.
Similar scenes were witnessed in the Lok Sabha with Opposition parties disrupting the proceedings for the third consecutive day by demanding Adjournment Motion (suspension of all work) and discussion on demonetisation under a rule that entails voting.

Parliamentary Affairs Minister Ananth Kumar said the government was ready for the debate if the Opposition allowed the discussion under Rule 193 that does not entail voting or passage of a resolution. The opposition rejected it.

Due to the uproar, the House was adjourned repeatedly and finally for the day at around 2 PM.

LUCKNOW: BSP chief Mayawati on Thursday slammed the demonetization of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 currency notes and said the country was facing a "financial emergency".
She told the media here that Prime Minister Narendra Modi was a master in hoodwinking people and deflecting attention from the real problems faced by them.
The problems people across the country were facing due to this decision were immense, something that neither Modi nor the central government was able to understand.
Almost 90 per cent of the population was fed up with the Modi government as most of its policies were neither clear nor in public interest, she said. 
The decision to withdraw the old Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes, she said, was not in public interest and had caused great inconvenience to the poor people, farmers and the working class. 
The small businesses have come to a grinding halt, the markets were shut and people do not know what to do now, she said, and accused the government of being insensitive to the problems of the common man.
She said that calling the demonetization a "surgical strike" was blind flattery and said income tax raids on the rich would have yielded more results.
BJP General Secretary Vijay Bahadur Pathak said the frustration of the BSP leader can be understood "for obvious reasons". 
"There is a problem in some areas. Within a few days all this will be sorted out," he said.

NEW DELHI: Narendra Modi government’s push for digital inclusion and narrow digital divide is getting wings with Union HRD ministry will be launching a campaign on December 1, involving youth to spread awareness regarding digital currency following the demonetization decision of the government.
HRD minister Prakash Javadekar on Tuesday said a road-map for the campaign is being prepared and it will be launched day after tomorrow. The HRD ministry will involve youth from leading institutions in the campaign.
"Last Sunday the Prime Minister had asked youth to spread awareness about digital currency after which we have received requests from many young people who have expressed interest. On December 1, we will launch a campaign in this regard," Javadekar said. In his 'Mann ki Baat' Radio address, the Prime Minister Narendra Modi had urged youth to spread awareness about digital financial literacy.
Javadekar was speaking on the sidelines of a special session where officers from the HRD ministry were made aware of the various ways of cashless transactions.
Javadekar would also address students through the National Knowledge Network (NKN), the day the campaign is launched.
The NKN is a state-of-the-art multi-gigabit pan-India network for providing a unified high-speed network backbone for all knowledge related institutions in the country.

NAGPUR: A case of "Khoda pahad nikli chuhiya". This is how the former finance minister P Chidambaram described the demonetization decision.
"Credit growth, greenfield investment and aggregate demand are on all time low due to demonetization. These numbers matter. It will take time for this country to go cashless. Why do the poor have to be punished for this? To assume that India will go from 3% to 100% cashless in a matter of few months is a outlandish expectations," he said at a press conference in Nagpur.
Commenting on RSS ideologue Gurumurthy's statement on the ultimate withdrawl of Rs 2000 notes, PC said, "I won't be surprised if they do so. Rs 2000 note is going to hoarders in huge numbers. Demonetisation is the biggest scam of the year and must be investigated". Congress will take efforts to create awareness about the mismanagement in and outside the house.

NEW DELHI: The BJP chief Amit Shah hailed the party victory in the local body elections in Chhatisgarh and Rajasthan and claimed that the people have given a positive mandate on the decision on demonetization.
“People have given a stamp of approval to the November 8 decisions of demonetization by voting for the BJP in the local body elections. After the November 8 decision on demonetization, people voted for the BJP in the local body elections in Rajsthan, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, and Chandigarh. The clear verdict by the people in favour of the BJP after the decision on demonetization gives a clear message that the they have supported the Prime Minister’s decision,” said Shah in a media statement.
While alleging that the Opposition, including the Congress, has been indulging in politics over the decision on demonetization, Shah claimed that the people have shown their support to the Prime Minister’s battle against corruption and black money. “People in different states and even in far away rural areas have shown that they are with the decision on demonetization. They have given a clear demonstration of what they think of the decision on demonetization, which the Opposition should understand,” Shah added.
The BJP chief also claimed that the local body poll wins also show people’s support for the “politics of performance” of the saffron outfit

NEW DELHI: Minister of State for Home Kiren Rijiju on Friday said smuggling of fake Indian currency notes (FICN) has completely stopped from three international borders – Pakistan, Bangladesh and Nepal – following the demonetization of Rs 1000 and Rs 500 notes.
 
“Smuggling of FICN from three international borders -- Pakistan, Bangladesh and Nepal -- has completely stopped after the announcement of demonetization by Prime Minister Narendra Modi,” Rijiju told reporters.
 
The minister said FICN worth around Rs 400 crore were in circulation in the economy at any given point in time and the decision (demonetization) was a major assault on black money and fake currency.
 
Quoting Intelligence reports, a senior Union Home ministry official said counterfeit currency with the face value of Rs 70 crore was introduced by the inimical interests every year in the country.
 
“Proceeds of illegal sale of drugs, opium and arms have also been completely stopped along with hawala transaction,” the official said.
 
Intelligence sources said fake notes with face value of Rs 12.35 crore were seized by the security agencies till June this year.
 
In 2015, counterfeit currency with face value of Rs 34.99 crore were seized followed by Rs 36.11 crore in in 2014 and Rs 42.90 crore in 2013. However, there are wide variations in the estimates of fake currency in circulation in the economy as Pakistani agencies have copied 90 per cent of the security features in the original currency notes. Barring the security thread, Pakistan has copied all the aspects including water mark, ink, motifs and currency paper, sources said. 
 
An estimated Rs 700-Rs 800 crore terror funding is done in India out of which Rs 300-Rs 400 crore are being used by Naxals annually, Rs 20-Rs 30 crore by terrorist groups and Rs 350-Rs 400 crore by insurgents in the Northeast.
 
The Home ministry has special FICN coordination group to share intelligence among different security agencies of states to crackdown on the circulation of fake currency notes. A terror funding and fake currency cell have also been established under the National Investigation Agency to stop terror funding and FICN activities.
 
“There has been a complete lull in the activities of the fake currency mafia after the old currency notes of Rs 1000 and Rs 500 were invalidated,” said an official.

KOLKATA: Commoners throughout West Bengal had a harrowing experience on Thursday due to shortage of new Rs 500 and Rs 2,000 currency notes, even as people skipped their work and stood in long queues in front of banks. Some people reached the banks as early as 6 am even when the state is of late experiencing a nip in the air after the depression over the Bay of Bengal cleared.
The situation took a violent turn at a bank in Garia, Kolkata over lesser amount given in exchange of what was announced and when the bank closed its operations before time.
Some patients brought a bag full of coins to a Kolkata hospital that refused to accept old Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes.
However, when the authorities refused to take the same, there were reports of clashes which were later brought under control by the police.
However, besides Kolkata, it was a total chaos in Siliguri, Asansol and Burdwan where people were either given a maximum of Rs 2,000 in new currency in exchange or asked to only deposit their old currency and withdraw new notes from Friday onwards.
“I had to skip lunch to stand in the queue and at the counter, I was told that I could exchange only Rs 2,000. It seems I have to ration my money and skip meal again tomorrow at the queue,” said one Gobardhan Dutta waiting at a bank in Beleghata, Kolkata.
Nepali-speaking Gorkhas in the hills in northern Bengal,too had to wait in long queues in the insufficient bank branches and post offices.
“Most of the people of our town have accounts in SBI and have only one branch here. Hence, we had to stand in the queue since 6 am. Finally, I got the promised Rs 4,000 in two Rs 2,000 notes,” Tsering Ongmu of Kalimpon told Express over the phone.

NEW DELHI: Former World Bank Chief Economist Kaushik Basu today said the Modi government's decision to demonetise high denomination currency notes is not 'good economics' and the collateral damage of demonetisation is likely to far outstrip the benefits.
“GST was good economics; the demonetization is not. Its economics is complex and the collateral damage is likely to far outstrip the benefits,” Basu, who was also Chief Economic Advisor in the Ministry of Finance, said in a tweet.
Basu is currently professor of Economics and C Marks Professor at Cornell University.
Basu on November 8 had said that with demonetisation, it is very likely that there will be a spike in gold and silver prices in India.
In its biggest crackdown ever on black money, the government on Tuesday night announced demonetisation of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 bank notes and asked people holding them to deposit into bank accounts.
Since yesterday, people have been thronging banks amid concerns over exchanging and depositing the scrapped currencies.
People can deposit old Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes in their accounts till December 30, 2016, without any limit. Restrictions have also been imposed on withdrawal limit and people can withdraw up to Rs 10,000 per day or Rs 20,000 per week. This limit will be reviewed after few days.

KOBE: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday said he was aware of the hardship people were facing in India because of the demonetisation move, but emphasized that it was necessary in the larger interests of the nation.

Addressing the Indian diaspora in Japan, Modi said people back home were hailing his decision of rendering Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes invalid but some of them were being prodded to speak against the government because of politics.

"I know it is difficult. People are made to speak against Modi but I salute the people... some stood in the queues for five hours, six hours but endured the hardship. The same way as people in Japan endured in 2011," he said, referring the earthquake-triggered tsunami five years ago that hit Japan.

He said the government had not taken the decision on demonetization in haste. "We had given 50 days to people to show their unaccounted wealth" till September, before the government decided to render the large currency bills illegal tender.

NEW DELHI: The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Wednesday questioned the ulterior motives of the opposition post Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi’s assertion as to how will replacing Rs 1,000 notes with Rs 2,000 notes curb black money, saying this move has brought miseries on the faces of those contesting the polls on black money and backing the corrupt. 
  
“The decision taken by the government to scarp Rs. 500 and 1,000 notes is a surgical strike on those providing financial assistance to terrorism. It is an attack on those spreading drugs and misguiding the nation’s youth. It is an attack on the corrupt,” BJP spokesperson Shrikant Sharma told ANI.
 
Alleging that the Congress Party has always sided with the corrupt, he lauded Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s apt decision.   
 
Launching a blistering attack on the government, Gandhi said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi had shown how little he cared about the ordinary people of this country.
 
Gandhi said that this decision has thrown farmers, small shopkeepers and housewives into “utter chaos. The real culprits sit tight on their black money stashed abroad or in bullion and real estate.”
 
“How is replacing Rs 1000 notes with Rs 2000 notes going to make black money hoarding a lot harder?” he added.
  
Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley has said the government's decision will move the country towards a cashless economy. 
 
Reassuring the people that those having lawful money would have nothing to fear, Jaitley said this is a major setback to the parallel black money economy because a lot of currency operating outside the system will now have to be brought into the banking system.
 
“The government believes that this decision has been welcomed everywhere. This major step with help India's credibility," he told media in New Delhi.
 
The Finance Minister further said this decision will change the way people spend and keep their money. 
 
He also said the decision is of significant advantage to the economy, adding both the Centre and states will benefit from with more revenue accruing in the economic system.

NEW DELHI: The day after the Union government’s demonetization of Rs 500 and Rs 1000 notes set the cat among the pigeons, Union revenue secretary Dr Hasmukh Adhia spelled out clearly what’s on the cards for tax evaders should they harbor notions of dodging this googly.
The revenue secretary was among a whole battery of bureaucrats who worked the media on Wednesday to explain the fine print of the demonetization order to common citizens as well as hoarders of black money. Excerpts from Adhia’s responses to media questions.
 A lot of small businessmen, housewives, artisans, and workers may have cash lying with them at home. Will the Income Tax department ask questions if they deposit the money in banks now? 
Such people need not worry about small amounts of money, say up to Rs 2 lakh since it might be below the taxable income. There will be no harassment by Income Tax Department for such small deposits.
Will the IT Department get reports about the cash deposits made in the next few days? If so, will the current threshold of reporting only cash deposits of more than Rs.10 lakh continue?
We will get reports of all cash deposited during the period from November 10 to December 30 if the amount is more than Rs 2.5 lakh in any one account.  The department will match this with the income returns filled. And suitable action may follow.
Suppose the department finds that a huge amount of cash above Rs 10 lacs is deposited in a bank account, and does not match with the income declared, what would be the tax and the penalty to be paid?
That would be treated as a case of tax evasion.The tax amount plus a penalty of 200 percent of the tax payable would be levied as per Section 270(A) of the Income Tax Act.
 It is believed that a lot of people are buying jewelry now. How will department tackle this?
A person who buys jewelry has to give his PAN number. We are issuing instructions to the field authorities to check with all the jewelers to ensure that this requirement is not compromised. Action will be taken against those jewelers who fail to take PAN numbers from such buyers. When the cash deposits of the jewelers are scrutinized against the sales made, we will check whether they have taken the PAN number of the buyer or not.

MUMBAI: The official price of gold climbed merely about one per cent on Thursday, but markets were abuzz with reports that the rates touched as high as Rs 65,000 per 10 gram with jewellers reportedly accepting demonetized big currency notes. There were also reports of IT raids being conducted on some jewellers.
"Jewellery shops in Ghatkopar (a suburb of Mumbai) did not close on Tuesday night. Small businessmen and traders who get cash every day as part of their business made a beeline to the shops and purchased a huge amount of gold, paying for it in Rs 1000 and Rs 500 notes," a businessman told the New Indian Express.
"Jewellers can show back-dated entries up to a week. Soe such transactions are expected to go on for around a week," he said, speaking on the condition of requesting anonymity.
"As soon as (Prime Minister Narendra) Modi made the announcement, the rates of gold were hiked by Rs 4000 per 10 gm. But as time passed and people started coming to shops with huge wads of demonetized currency notes, the rates rose to around Rs 45000 for 10 gm. The next day it spiked further. Today it touched a high of around Rs 65000," he said.
There were unconfirmed reports that people even purchased gold for Rs 70000. But once news of IT raids spread, such transactions began to checken out. 
"Transactions like this must have happened elsewhere too," said a gold valuer at a multi-state cooperative bank in Mumbai.
IT officials confirmed they carried out some raids on jewellers, but declined to divulge details. "Raids were conducted on a few jewellers today to check malpractices after the demonetization of big currency. We request all jewellers to support the step taken by the Prime Minister," a statement released by the India Bullion and Jewellers Association (IBJA) said.
Unconfirmed reports said at least six traders in Zaveri Bazar in Mumbai were raided by IT officials.
Meanwhile, market reports from across Maharashtra said business was sluggish on Thursday due to of nonavailability of cash.

NEW DELHI: A day after his predecessor Manmohan Singh alleged demonetization was a “case of organised loot and legalised plunder and reflected a ‘monumental management failure’, the Prime Minister Narendra Modi has hit back on opposition.
Taking a dig at his political rivals, PM Modi said that they would have ‘lavished praised’ on him if he had given them time before making announcing the scheme.
Speaking at a book launch in the Parliament House library, Prime minister said, ”Some people are alleging the government did not make ample preparation. I think that is not the issue that the government did not make ample preparation. I think the pain of such people is that the government did not give a chance to make any preparation".
Calling every citizen as the ‘soldier’ who is fighting a battle against corruption, Modi said that “if these people had got 72 hours to make their preparation then they would have lavished praise that there is no one like Modi.”
Modi’s remark attracted a sharp criticism from the opposition in Rajya Sabha and members demaning an apology from him. Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad said that “PM today said that opposition is favouring black money, this is a serious allegation against the entire Opposition, he must apologise". His point was echoed by the BSP supremo Mayawati who wanted PM must come to House and apologise.
In his address on the book launch, PM noted India's name features prominently in global corruption surveys which is not something to be proud of, he said, some decisions have to be taken in the interest of the nation.
Supporting his stand, Prime Minister pointed out that civic bodies have benefited by the demonetisation move. He claimed that  several municipal corporations have collected Rs. 13,000 crore tax, which was earlier only limited to 3,000-3,500 crore.” Anyway, this money will be used for developmental work of the area like roads and power supply,” PM added.

NEW DELHI: The logjam in the Lok Sabha continued for 13 days in a row with the Opposition unrelenting on its demand for discussion on the issue of demonetization under a rule which entails voting. Even while the Union Minister for Home Affairs Rajnath Singh stated that the government is keen to listen to the suggestions of the Opposition on the issue of implementation of the decision on demonetization, the Opposition dug its heels on voting even while a section of leaders dropped hints that the House may begin discussion from Wednesday.
 
After the House was adjourned amid repeated adjournments, a senior opposition leader, while speaking to reporters, said that there has been a unanimous decision to participate in the discussion under Rule 193 from Wednesday on the issue of demonetization. Even while the discussion was initiated by the TRS MP Jeetendra Reddy under Rule 193, which is without adjournment of the business of the House and voting, the TMC MPs surrounded him and indulged in slogan shouting, which led to the Speaker Sumitra Mahajan adjourning the House for the day.
 
“There was a meeting of the Opposition parties this morning and it was decided that before the Parliament session ends, we must register our voices as till now they have not said a word on demonetization in the Lok Sabha,” said the TMC MP.
 
The leader said that the meeting was attended by TMC, Congress, Left parties, JD(U), BSP, SP, NCP, DMK, AAP and JMM. The parliament session ends December 16. 
 
Earlier in the day, the Speaker sought the views of the leaders of the political parties during which the Congress floor leader Mallikarjuna Kharge reiterated the demand to initiate the discussion under Rule 184. The Samajwadi Party chief Mulayam Singh Yadav lamented that the government did not take leaders of all political parties in confidence before announcing the decision on demonetization.
 
While intervening, Union Minister for Home Affairs noted that there is a marked “division” within the Opposition on the mode of discussion. “There is a clear view that there is no question on the intention of the decision. The Opposition parties have expressed issues concerning the implementation. The government will like to listen to the suggestions to improve the implementation,” Singh added. However, there was no breakthrough, which led Speaker to adjourn the House till 2 pm.
 
The House witnessed the discussion being initiated under Rule 193 by TRS MP A P Jeetendra Reddy. As Reddy began to speak, TMC members surrounded him and started shouting slogans. Trinamool members used Reddy’s microphone to shout slogans thus disrupting the proceedings. 
 
Some Congress MPs also joined Trinamool and they came into the well of the house. Efforts by Parliamentary Affairs Minister Ananth Kumar to pacify the opposition and continue the discussion proved futile. Amdist the din, the house was adjourned for the day.  TMC members were later seen shaking hands with Reddy, who also walked to the treasury benches and spoke to Home Minister.

In the light of excessive black money circulation, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday evening announced in what comes as a key economic decision, the demonetization of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 currency notes with immediate effect.
In a televised address to the country directly, Modi said that from midnight of 8th November all Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 rupee notes would be illegal in all forms of transactions, except with certain conditions. 
He addressed this as a solution to work towards hoarding black money and creating a new inflow of cash for the Indian economy.
Following are the significant takeaways from this decision:
Milk booths, crematoria, hospitals exempted from ban till November 11th
Upto November 24th exchanges of old currencies will be allowed in banks and  Post Offices by showing ID proof like aadhaar card and PAN card.
An ATM upper limit withdrawal up to Rs. 4000 will be put into place for security reasons until all people have sufficient legal notes in place. 
Old notes can be deposited in banks till Dec 30, 2016. All banks and ATMs will be shut on Nov 9.
The old notes can, however, be used to buy air and rail tickets at the counter for a certain period only.
Card payments and other online transactions will work as usual
Soon after the Prime minister’s address, the RBI governor Urijit Patel while briefing a press conference released displayed the "specimen" of new 500 rupee note that has an image of the Red Fort and will be known as Mahatma Gandhi series of bank notes. The Rs 2000  note has the Mangalyaan, signifying the importance of scientific contributions. The sizes, however, will be smaller than the current notes.
The RBI governor said, "Fake Indian currency notes of Rs 500 and Rs 1000 have been increasing" in circulation. The governor also said that production of lower currency denomination notes to meet the requirement has been ramped up. 
In the last five years, circulation of Rs 500 notes has increased by 76% and Rs 1000 notes by 109%, while the economy has expanded at 30%, said Shaktikantha Das, secretary of Economic Affairs.
While the RBI committee continues to answer questions in the press conference, the following are the control room numbers they have released for safety and security purposes. 022- 22602944. 011-23090230. 22602201.
The RBI committee also appealed to the public that they should not approach people holding unaccounted/ illegal cash for exchanging lower denominations since the banks will be scrutinizing and keeping a tab over every note that is being exchanged.
