 MATHURA (UTTAR PRADESH): As an affirmative support towards government’s decision for a cashless economy, Nayati Multi Super Specialty Hospital, Mathura partnered with Punjab National Bank to install the first Micro ATM in the region in the hospital premise on a trial basis.The micro-ATM is a portable machine which is based on a mobile phone connection. Customers after getting their identity authenticated can withdraw money from their bank accounts.Niira Radia, chairperson, Nayati Healthcare, said, “To facilitate unhindered patient care post demonetization we had taken various steps – from free OPD in the hospital, to outreach camps, to cashless transactions such as e-payment, net banking, credit and debit card, e-wallets etc. We understand and appreciate that it will take some time before people in this region get used to using e-payment options. PNB micro ATM is one formal direction that we have taken in addition to various cashless payment options.”Punjab National Bank has installed Micro ATM on a trial basis at Nayati Hospital and has assured the hospital that a full-fledged ATM will soon be made available. “We have also noticed that many patients do not have bank accounts. Patients will now be able to open the bank accounts with PNB in the hospital itself,” said Radia.Explaining the services that will be provided through the Micro ATM, Yateesh Wahal, executive director, finance, Nayati Healthcare, said, “The installation of the micro ATM at the hospital premise will ease the problem as patients will no longer have to queue outside banks or ATM. The money will come from the cash drawer of the Bank Mitra / Business Correspondent.”“The basic transaction types that will be supported by the Micro ATM are withdrawal, fund transfer and balance enquiry. Transactions will be through RuPay or Debit cards and even Aadhaar based transactions will be possible. Customer identification through this hand-held device will be done through biometric or PIN number,” added Wahal.

PUNE: There has been a 37% decline in property registrations across the state since the demonetization of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 currency notes.As per the inspector general of registration and controller of stamps, from an average of 7,299 documents per day from August to October, the number has come down to around 4,588 since the demonetization move — from November 9 to 15.The IGR registered a total of 4.89 lakh documents in the three-month period (August-October), averaging around 7,299 registrations per day. The revenue for this period stood at Rs 1,410.91 crore, averaging about Rs 64.13 crore per day. For the month of November so far, the revenue collection has been Rs 281.85 crore, averaging about Rs 31.22 crore per day, the IGR stated.“A comparative analysis of the last three-month period and the one after the demonetization shows a 37% decrease in daily registrations,” IGR N Ramaswami told TOI.Officials from the state department of registration and stamps attributed the dip in numbers to the component of cash demanded by the builders. “While 98% of the cash to be given to the IGR is paid online, the document handling charges too have been allowed via demand draft. Considering this, the decrease in registrations is not because of the department, but due to the cash component demanded by the builders,” the officials said.Property investors said buyers are delaying registrations ever since the Centre announced the demonetization of high denomination currency notes.Amit Shah of Wadgaon Budruk, who was scheduled to register his flat on November 10, has delayed it by a month. “The demonetization move has left me cashless. Now, I will register my house some other time,” he said.Sherna Vakil of Kondwa, another buyer, had entered into talks with a leading developer for registration last week. However, he too has to postpone the property registration by a fortnight. “I know the entire process is by cheque, but there is so much confusion regarding the demonetization and hardly any cash in hand to go ahead with the registration,” she added.Developers too observed a dip in registration due to the sudden demonetization move. Credai vice-president, Pune Rohit Gera said there are different segments in the realty sector which involve cash components, especially in the luxury segment. “The dip in registrations in the last four days is mainly due to the cash crunch, prompting people to postpone property registrations,” Gera said. However, steps should be taken by the state government to ensure that there are no cash payments involved in property registrations to clean the system, he added.“There is a need to check on the number of approvals given before the demonetization move,” Gera suggested.

NEW DELHI: Mobile handset makers are seeing an inventory pile up, which may force them to alter production schedules and defer launches as retailers who have seen their sales plunge due to the cash crunch among consumers have almost stopped adding stock, say industry and analysts.They add that the situation since the demonetization announcement on November 8 may also affect shipment numbers for handset makers in the October-December quarter which usually sees lower sales than the previous one which caters to the peak festive season demand."Dealers have been sitting idle, some shops are also closed, because consumers are not coming to buy phones and sellers are not accepting old currency notes. There's an inventory pile up happening and this dry spell will continue till November 25, till the time cash is easily accessible to consumers," said Ravinder Zutshi, mobile council head at Consumer Electronics and Appliances Manufacturers Association (CEAMA).Several brick and mortar retail stores across Delhi NCR region that ET spoke to said sales were down 70-80% from pre-demonetization days, which have left them with significant quantities of unsold stock –mainly lower priced ones which are usually bought through cash. Large retail format stores, which have the option of payment by cards – unlike most smaller mom-and-pop retailers - also said sales were sharply down immediately for the first few days after demonization, but have improved slightly since.“There are no customers. Our existing stock isn’t selling, so where is the question of ordering more stock,” said Rajesh Chauhan, the owner of a small brick-and-mortar shop selling handsets in the NCR region, adding that sales for him is down around 80%.Gionee India managing director Arvind Vohra said that sales had declined 30 percent in the first two to three days, but has recovered to a fall of 10-15 percent in the last couple of days."There has been an average 14-15% drop in sell outs in the past few days after the announcement. However, this is momentary and sale will be on track in a fortnight for us," said Navin Chawla, Lava's Chief operating officer.Handset makers such as Micromax, Lava and Gionee, television and white goods makers are all watching the situation closely, amid the inventory pile up, but are yet to take a call on modifying their production schedules. The inventory pile up for TV and white goods industry is still insignificant as of now since the industry anyways adjusts its production after Diwali when sales takes a dip as a routine phenomenon, added industry insiders.“We are cautious and are watching the situation closely. There could only be corrections in production lines…That decision will take 10 days down the line,” Vohra said.Currently, of the total phones sold in India on a monthly basis, 70% are made locally.Tarun Pathak, senior analyst at Counterpoint Research, believes sales of handsets during the October-December quarter, especially the ones under $100 (Rs6,700), will be hit.“In terms of supply chain, we believe retailers will have inventory issues while OEMs (original equipment makers) may defer new launches till the situation streamlines,” he added.To spur sales and reduce inventory, retailers and vendors could aggressively push installment schemes, he added.Avijit Mitra, CEO of Infiniti Retail, which runs the Croma brand of stores, said his company has started “a ‘0-0-0’ finance scheme, where a consumer need not pay anything upfront, zero processing fee and no interest on EMI, across all products at Croma store, with a few exceptions”.On credit card transactions, zero cost EMI is being offered where the company will discount the interest charged by the bank on the bill of the product, and the consumer can pay for the product across three EMIs. Most of sales through Croma stores happens through credit cards, debit cards or finance schemes, while cash transactions are limited to 20% of overall sales.

New Delhi: Currency demonetization has caused consumption to fall at the rate of 30 per cent in segments including luxury and Food & Beverage revealed by brand owners. They have also said how the consumption has impacted trade in Delhi NCR malls recently.“The malls look empty and the ‘deadness’ in the bright mall spaces has dampened the desire to buy high end products. We have seen a 30% decline, with a large regional variation with biggest drops in NCR and the least drop in Chennai & in the South,” said Dilip Kapur, founder and president of luxury brand Hidesign.“In Saket, Delhi our footfall has dropped down by about 25% to 30% which is quite substantial. Also, one of the big reasons is basically the malls are running empty so the impact of demonetization is I believe is very high because we are located in a mall in Delhi. From a standalone restaurant perspective Hard Rock in general has been impacted to about 15 % in non-mall locations,” said Jay Singh, co-founder and executive director, JSM Corporation that runs Hard Rock Café, which is an international theme restaurant chain.The Saket, New Delhi based mall did not respond on the matter.DLF Mall of India spokesperson Pushpa Bactor told to ETRetail that she is expecting a recovery in the retail sector and is hoping the consumers will adapt to other modes of payments soon. "The decision will definitely have an impact on the retail sector as significant number of the transactions is executed in cash. We hope to see recovery in the retail sector soon as customers will adapt to other modes of payment available to them,” she said.Non-mall brands too have registered drop in sales and such brands said, the fall in consumption is more than 30 per cent. For example, BoConcept, a bridge to luxury international home-furniture brand said they have witnessed 40% drop in sales. “The demonetisation of the currency has adversely affected retail, almost by a 40% drop in sales, customers are differing their decisions on big ticket purchase for now. We are confident that the sales will pick up once everything has stabilised,” said Navin Khanna, director, BoConcept.F & B outlets in Delhi NCR are too struggling. NRAI President and CEO of Impressario Hospitality and Entertainment, Riyaz Amlani said he observed a drop of 40-45 per cent in consumer spending in restaurants. “Consumer spends at restaurants dropped as much as 40-45 per cent On Wednesday. But for long term this move is very positive and will benefit the growth of the sector.”Industry body KPMG, who tracks development of the Retail sector said, this fall could range between 30-40%. “It is hard to estimate the drop in sales at this point, but based on conversation with various retailers and brands, this could be in the range of 30-40% for these few weeks for brick & mortar retail,” said Rajat Wahi, Partner, Management Consulting, KPMG India.A few non-luxury brands on condition of anonymity also said that, a large section of luxury purchases which used to happen through ‘unaccounted money’ through cash transaction mostly feeling the heat. However, they say, for other segments including F & B, fashion and footwear, brands will soon start seeing better numbers in coming days.

"If we receive notifications from the Centre, we will continue taking notes," spokesperson of IMC said.IMC also received a record collection of Rs.6.5 crore in the form of property tax and water tax in a single day after demonetization was announced.
