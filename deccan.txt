Unmindful of murmurs in the opposition over his stand on demonetisation, Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar today maintained his support to the exercise, asserting that he will back any attack on corruption irrespective of party affiliations.Often seen as a possible opposition candidate for prime ministership in 2019 Lok Sabha polls, he said no serious attempt is currently being made to bring together non-BJP parties.A grand alliance of the opposition parties at the national level is certain to win the elections but no such scene was in sight, he said.He asserted there is no problem in the ruling grand alliance in Bihar and mocked speculation about his growing proximity with BJP, saying he would not offer denial on all kinds of reports as denial is 50 per cent confirmation.Kumar's strong support to 'notebandi', which has riled leaders like TMC chief Mamata Banerjee, came at a meeting organised by his party JD(U) and later at HT Leadership Summit even as another top leader of his party Sharad Yadav targeted the Modi government over demonetisation in his presence."This 'notebandi' is a positive step which will lead to benefits. It will happen," the JD(U) President said, terming corruption and black money as a "big sin and festering wound" which must be eradicated."Severe steps will have to be taken. That is why we offered our support to this (demonetization). It is a positive beginning... Whenever there is an attack on corruption, I will support it," he said.The JD(U) president also refrained from any criticism on the manner of its implementation causing inconvenience to people, an issue vociferously raised by the opposition and his party colleague Yadav.Asked about Yadav and other opposition parties raising the issue of people's difficulties, he said, "I don't speak about it because those facing difficulties should be speaking. No such voice is being heard. People are in difficulty but the poor thinks he is facing problem today but a lot of money of the rich is sinking."Yadav is highlighting these difficulties, Kumar said, adding that there is no problem in that. "We have no difference of opinion." Kumar, however, added that demonetization alone will not end black money and asked Prime Minister Narendra Modi to also launch a crackdown on benami properties immediately and target tainted money hoarded in assets like gold and diamonds. Now is the right time to do so, he said."Currency forms a significant part of black money but total black money is much more than that. The country's money has been laundered to overseas as well and that too should be brought back," he said.Kumar's remarks in support of demonetization, which has united most of the opposition parties against it, came after Yadav hit out at Modi dispensation over the issue.Yadav alleged the decision is aimed at recapitalising banks that were "sinking" due to Rs 8.5 lakh crore of Non- Performing Assets and its goal is not to target black money.Kumar, however, did not touch upon the implementation part of demonetization, merely saying that his government does everything with due preparation and so should the Centre."We support demonetization. It should be implemented with preparation. We do our work with full preparation. They (Centre) should also have done that."We said there can be nothing better if it helps curb corruption, bring out some amount of black money and illegal work is stopped to some extent," he said.  **************************************************

Taking a dig at West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, one of the most vocal critics of demonetization who had attacked him at a public meeting in Patna, Nitish Kumar said too much aggression affects perception which is important in democracy. "People will ask why somebody is so aggressive.""I support something which I agree with and oppose which I do not... Media does not look at things in a simple and normal way and does things for publicity," he said, referring to political speculation over his support to demonetisation.Playing down reports that he could be prime ministerial candidate, he said nobody attains the highest office just by declaring oneself a candidate, and if somebody has to become Prime Minister, it does not matter whether he is a candidate or not."Just by having ambition one does not become Prime Minister... My national ambition is to make JD(U) a national party like the original Janata Dal which my party represents now."He also batted for nation-wide prohibition, which he has enforced in Bihar, saying a lot of black money is generated by the liquor trade and now is the right time to go after it.At the party meeting organised by its Delhi unit, he asked workers to establish the outfit across the city which has a substantial population of migrants from Bihar.Condition in many parts of Delhi is worse than villages in Bihar, he said.His party had supported AAP in the last assembly polls.Kumar asked party leaders to raise the issues of prohibition in Delhi and granting the city full statehood.  **************************************************


Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi today accused the government of not allowing him to speak in Parliament on demonetization, which he dubbed as the "biggest scam", and said he would reveal in the House what was behind the move to scrap high denomination notes.Speaking to reporters outside Parliament, Gandhi said that his party wants debate on demonetization so that the truth can come to the fore, but the government is running away from it.The Congress Vice President said that when he gets a chance to speak about demonetization in the House, "the Prime Minister will not be able to even sit there"."The Prime Minister is giving speeches across the country but is afraid of coming to the Lok Sabha and is not willing to sit there," Gandhi said and asked what could be the reason for this "nervousness"."Demonetization is the biggest scam in the history of India.... I want to speak in Lok Sabha. I will tell everything there," Gandhi said and accused the government of not allowing him to speak in the House on the issue.The Congress leader was speaking after his party said in Lok Sabha that it was ready to debate the issue but the government demanded that it should first apologise to the people of the country for stalling Parliament proceedings for 16 days, leading to uproar and adjournment of the House.Gandhi said initially the Government spoke about black-money, then moved to counterfeit currency and then again to a cashless society campaign.He said, "I want to tell about the the biggest scam committed by Narendra Modi single handedly" and present the "voice of people, specially poor, who have suffered due to this move".He said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi should come to the House so that it can be discussed "what demonetization is, who has benefited from this decision is and what it means for whom".He added that the government had initially proposed debate on demonetization to which his party agreed but then the government backtracked. "If they allow me to speak in Parliament, you will see an earthquake will happen," Gandhi told reporters.  **************************************************


Congress today sought to pick holes in the Modi government demonetizing Rs 500 and Rs 1000 currency notes, saying if the idea was to address the issue of black money why has it decided to introduce Rs 2000 denomination notes, and terming the action as a "puzzle".The main opposition party said if the common man faced problems in exchanging the demonetized notes, it would amount to "pure and simple harrassment".Former Finance Minister P Chidambaram told reporters that a similar move was also contemplated by the previous UPA government but the idea was dropped as "the economic gains were not too great"."Introduction of Rs 2000 note is a puzzle. How will this help in preventing generation of black money? If new income or wealth is unaccounted, will it not be hidden in Rs 2000 notes. How the purpose of demonestization of high denomination notes is served if a new and higher denomination note is introduced? Government must explain this apparent puzzle," he said.Chidambaram, a former Finance Minister, said Congress supported any move to check black money, but warned that the demonetization exercise may cause initial contraction and disruption of economic activity. The real test, he said, would be how quickly the old notes are replaced.Chidambaram said while he supports the government's action taken to stamp out black money, "but the method adopted raises many questions"."We support the objective of government to stamp out black money. But the method they have adopted raises questions...The move has come as a bolt from the blue for the common man," he said."The move may cause initial contraction and some disruption of economic activity. The test will be how quickly the old notes are replaced," Chidambaram said.The former Finance Minister asked the government to handle the exchange of notes quickly, efficiently and without harassment to common people.Chidambaram spoke soon after Rahul Gandhi targeted Prime Minister Narendra Modi over the move, wondering as to how bringing in the new Rs 2000 note is going to make black money hoarding a lot harder.In remarks laced with sarcasam, the Congress Vice President said "well done Mr Modi"."Real culprits" who have stashed black money are "sitting tight" while lives of farmers, small shopkeepers and houswives "have been thrown in utter chaos," he said in a series of tweets.Chidambaram said that introduction of the new series of notes is estimated to cost Rs 15,000 to Rs 20,000 crore and "the economic gains of demonetization should be at least equal to that amount"."If RBI form is made mandatory for housewives, small traders, it will be pure harassment and Congress party will condemn it," he said in reply to a question.Asked if it will help curb the use of black money used for funding terror activities, he said it is "complete exaggeration" to say that the bulk of black money is used for terrorist activities or to say that bulk of it is counterfeit money. **************************************************


The Enforcement Directorate today seized Rs 2.19 crore from here as part of its operation to check hawala trade in the wake of demonetisation.Officials said the sleuths of the agency swooped down on the premises of the cloth trader and few other locations here, based on a tip off received by them about huge illegal currency stashing.While the ED said Rs 18 lakh in new notes was recovered, Punjab Police said Rs 69.35 lakh in new currency was recovered during the raid. The action has been taken under the provisions of the Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA) and the searches are still on, they said.Chandigarh DSP Ram Gopal said a team led by ED's Deputy Director Gurnam Singh conducted a raid and seized Rs 1.50 crore in demonetised currency and Rs 69.35 lakh in new currency.The raid was carried out at house of one Inderpal Mahajan. He has been arrested and a case has been registered against him, the DSP said.He said the ED team has seized notes for further verification. The Enforcement Directorate has been carrying out searches and enquiry at various places in the wake of de-monetisation. **************************************************


Prime Minister Narendra Modi's "masterstroke" to demonetise Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes could be reduced to a "nasty partisan conspiracy" or a "costly political joke" if it fails to deliver on its high-sounding promises, Chinese official media commented today."While it takes political courage to launch such a trailblazing and massive campaign; it actually takes far more wisdom to give it a happy ending," an article in the state-run Global Times said."Given the fact that people have to pay an absurdly high price for the expected reform, if BJP fails to deliver its high-sounding rhetoric and promises, then Modi's much-lauded 'masterstroke' or 'big bang reform' will likely be reduced to 'nasty partisan conspiracy' and even a 'costly political joke'," it said.The article noted that demonetisation is by no means new to India. However, rooting out India's perennial and enormous black economy has never been an easy mission, it said."If Modi fails to supplement the blitzkrieg reform with more enduring and fundamental measures, any beneficial effects the reform has created may evaporate quickly, even if Indian people have paid an absurdly high social and economic price so far," the article said.The demonetisation may also benefit BJP, it said. "Modi's move also carries an implicit albeit thick partisan agenda: Sudden demonetisation may hurt other political parties' funding more than his own Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), rendering the BJP a significant upper hand in the upcoming elections in Uttar Pradesh and Punjab," it alleged."In the electorally pivotal states of UP and Punjab, BJP's primary rivalries are often local and smaller parties which have less diversified funding and depend heavily on small cash donations," it noted."So, even if BJP suffers blowback from the clampdown, it is likely to end up less affected, thanks to its national network as well as the numerous 'family member' organisations affiliated to it," the article asserted.The article stated that Modi's "heroic image" embodied in the anti-black money campaign is also something BJP can bank on, especially as the party seemingly "lacks a strong chief ministerial face" in UP now."While Modi may find pacifying chaos in the short-term and correcting structural distortion in the long-term (they) are both hard policy goals, the partisan politics appears to be the only low-hanging fruit he can readily pluck," it said.In the last decade, undocumented sources like cash donations accounted for around 75 per cent of the funding for India's political parties, it added. "Given this, the sudden clampdown on black money may also be seen as Modi's clever electioneering for the upcoming elections in Uttar Pradesh and Punjab," it claimed.  **************************************************


With uncertanity over implementation of GST, rising crude oil prices and the challenging 4 per cent CPI in medium term, Reserve Bank may cut repo rate for the final time by a 25 basis points in the February policy, says a report."We hold on to our expectation of a 25 basis points rate cut in February, but caution that this would likely bring the easing cycle to an end, given the pressures in the horizon – implementation of the GST bill, rising oil prices, implementation of government employees housing allowance, and the challenging 4 per cent CPI target for the medium term," HSBC said in a report today.RBI has set an objective for achieving consumer price index (CPI) inflation at 5 per cent by the third quarter of the financial year 2016-17 and the medium-term target of 4 per cent within a band of +/- 2 per cent.Retail inflaion eased to 3.41 per cent in December, which is a 25-month low as against 3.63 per cent in November. The report said the RBI will meet its 5 per cent CPI target for March comfortably.HSBC said since demonetization, high frequency food data has been moderating. "As such, we are not surprised to see both a y-o-y and m-o-m non-seasonally adjusted fall in December prices. Vegetables, pulses and fruits led the charge," it said.The November Index of Industrial Production (IIP) rose to 13-month high of 5.7 per cent compared to the contraction of 1.9 per cent in October.The report said the numbers need to be interpreted with care as the IIP series tend to undergo sharp revisions as more companies report production activity and subsequent revisions could well be downward."Also, much of the pain following demonetization is likely to show up in upcoming months," it said. The HSBC report said on the back of the ongoing cash crunch (still a 40 per cent contraction in effective currency in circulation), it expects GDP to grow 5 per cent y-o-y in the October-December quarter and 6 per cent y-o-y in the January-March quarter."We expect growth to normalize gradually towards the 7 per cent ballpark, but remain shy of the 7.5-8 per cent range in the financial year 2017-18, due to adjustment costs that businesses and consumers face, in the process of formalization and digitization," the report said. **************************************************


Manufacturing sector growth in India got hampered in November as rupee demonetisation weighed on new work flows, buying activity and production, while subdued inflationary pressure may prompt RBI to reduce key policy rate, a monthly survey said today.The Nikkei Markit India Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) -- a gauge of manufacturing performance -- fell to 52.3, down from October's 22-month high of 54.4.A reading above 50 in terms of manufacturing performance indicates expansion, while anything below it means contraction."PMI data for November showed that the sudden withdrawal of high-value banknotes in India caused problems for manufacturers, as cash shortages hampered growth of new work, buying activity and production," Pollyanna De Lima, Economist at IHS Markit and author of the report, said.November data highlighted an 11th consecutive monthly improvement in manufacturing conditions across India. "However, whereas some may have anticipated an outright downturn, the sector held its ground and remained in expansion mode," Lima said.Furthermore, although many surveyed companies commented that further disruption is expected in the near-term, the demonetisation of the rupee is anticipated to ignite growth in the long-run as unregulated companies leave the market, Lima added.Softer expansion in new business inflows affected manufacturing sector growth during November as order books rose at a moderate pace which was the slowest since July.Panelists reported higher demand from domestic as well as external clients, but indicated that growth was hampered by the money crisis, the survey said, adding, money issue was the main reason listed by respondents for softer growth in input buying.On the prices front, the report said that though there was an overall increase in input costs, the rate of inflation eased since October."Of respite to firms, cost inflationary pressures softened, which in turn encouraged the vast majority of businesses to keep their selling prices unchanged. If this trend is sustained, we will likely see further cuts to the benchmark rate," Lima said.The Monetary Policy Committee, headed by RBI Governor Urjit Patel, in October cut benchmark interest rates by 0.25 per cent to 6.25 per cent. The next RBI policy review is on December 7. **************************************************


Prime Minister Narendra Modi today said he is working on a formula on how to send the corrupt to jail who deposited their money in Jan Dhan accounts of poor after demonetization and ensure this money goes to the poor households.Responding to criticism over long queues outside banks and ATMS since the note ban decision on November 8, he accused his rivals of trying to "spread disinformation and despair" and said "this will be the last queue for the people who have been standing in line for the last 70 years for their daily needs"."All those who are Jan Dhan account holders, you should not return the money that others have put in your accounts. If you promise to do so, I am working hard on to devise a formula to send all those who deposited their money illegally into your accounts to jail and to ensure the money goes to the poor households," Modi said addressing a public rally here.Jan Dhan accounts were opened under a special campaign for providing banking facilities to the poor launched by the Modi Government in August, 2014.He said the corrupt rich are not doing any favour, as they have looted this money from the poor in all these years."I salute the people of the country for standing for long hours in queues."I want to ask those politicians who are crying over these long queues."You kept the entire nation in queues for 70 years after independence, as one had to stand in lines for even sugar, kerosene and wheat in the past. This is the last queue to end all those queues," he said to applause from the crowds.The PM said only the honest can queue up outside the banks to deposit the money, while the corrupt are standing outside the houses of poor.Modi said he was being hounded by his rivals as "culprit" on the note ban issue and pledged that this fight against the corrupt and corruption shall not stop "come what may"."I am being hounded as if I have committed some crime by waging a battle against graft. But, what can my opponents do to me? I am a fakir (hermit)...jhola ley kar chaley jayenge (I will exit with my little belongings)," he said.Modi was addressing BJP's Parivartan Yatra to mobilise public support ahead of the upcoming Assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh.Tearing into the opposition, he said, "Some call me a culprit.... Is it a crime to fight corruption which is at the root cause of all ills prevailing in the country for the past 70 years?"Without naming any party, Modi made a subtle reference to Congress when he said that the 1.25 crore people were his leaders and he had no high command."You are my leader...I have no high command," he said.His attack against the opposition came in the backdrop of their protests inside and outside Parliament on noteban, where the Winter Session has so far been almost washed out with the uproar eclipsing the proceedings every day.Talking tough, Modi said corruption will not go on its own and has to be wiped out. **************************************************

Modi said many governments in the past made announcements but this is the first government which gives an account of the work done to the people of the country.The Prime Minister said government should not be merely for making announcements. It should launch schemes and ensure their effective implementation.Attacking the opposition, he said parties in power in the past had worked only for themselves and for their near ones, but not for the poor."I had announced from Red Fort that power will reach 18,000 villages deprived of it in 1,000 days. There were over 1,000 villages in Uttar Pradesh alone. In half the time, over 950 villages have been taken care of," he claimed.He rued that corruption has snatched rights of the poor and said, "Shouldn't I fight corruption? Is fighting corruption a crime? Why are some people calling me a wrong doer for fighting corruption."Asking the poor not to withdraw any money from their Jandhan accounts, he said, "I will fix those who used to chant 'money, money' earlier and are now saying 'Modi, Modi'."Modi said his decision to ban notes did not go down well with the corrupt as they were facing the pinch.He said the rich do not have the strength to stand in queues and are thus queuing up outside the homes of the poor for depositing their money into their accounts."The dishonest people are unable to go to banks and deposit their ill-gotten wealth. They are the ones complaining against the government's demonetization move," he said."Today the dishonest are queuing up outside the houses of the poor after demonetization for their help through the Jandhan accounts," he said."The corrupt and rich people have asked poor villagers to safeguard their money for them, to stand in lines and deposit it in banks for them. Instead of standing in queues at banks, they are standing in queues outside the houses of the poor," the prime minister said."Those who have money to hide are the ones blaming me," he said, asking the gathering, "Should I not fight corruption? Will corruption disappear by itself?"The common man is fed up with corruption and "if people come to know the intentions are good, they are ready to face any challenge", he said referring to those standing in long queues outside banks and ATMs.Asking people to go digital, Modi told them to use their mobile phone as their wallet and there was no need to use cash."People will not forgive the corrupt, the country has to be rid of all ills during the past 70 years," he said.Modi reminded BJP volunteers and party workers once again of the government's assurance that things will ease up after a period of 50 days."I had said there will be hardships for now, but things will improve. You might have to stand in queues to withdraw money, but it's essential to eliminate corruption," he said, and cited instances of parents doling out heavy sums for admission of their children in schools and for higher studies.On shortage of currency notes, Modi suggested use of plastic money and to go cashless."There are 40 crore smartphones in the country today. Everything is available on mobile banking, net banking and through credit and debit cards. You just need to download an app on your phone, and for 40 crore people, everything is possible without visiting a bank or standing in queues," he said.Modi also hit out at those saying people were resisting change or were technologically challenged, saying "they should remember that the same people elected a new government by pushing a button.""Some people have lost glow on their faces... earlier they used to chant money-money, now they are chanting Modi-Modi," he said.He said to eradicate poverty from country, it has to be removed first from big states like Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Maharashtra and West Bengal.Modi cited the example of Madhya Pradesh to highlight the efficiency of BJP rule."Madhya Pradesh was considered a 'Bimaru' state. But the people of MP gave BJP a chance. The state government there, led by Shivraj Singh Chouhan, has transformed the state. Today, Madhya Pradesh is a shining example of efficiency," he added.  **************************************************

Opposition parties which have been protesting against demonetization today decided to approach President Pranab Mukherjee on the Income Tax Amendment Bill to seek his intervention, alleging that the measure was hurriedly passed in Lok Sabha without following the rules.A meeting of opposition parties was held in the chamber of Leader of Opposition in Rajya Sabha Ghulam Nabi Azad today morning. It was decided that their delegation will meet Mukherjee this evening.A united opposition will also hand over a memorandum to the President raising the issue of "trampling" of democratic rights of MPs as the bill was passed without discussion amid din due to BJP's "brute majority" in the Lower House, leaders said after the meeting."Representatives of a number of opposition parties met and decided to approach the President on the issue of Income Tax Amendment Bill passed in Lok Sabha," Azad said.The opposition is also alleging that since Presidential assent was not sought beforehand on the amendments in the Bill, it amounted to "undermining" the authority of the President and rules and procedures were not followed.The parties have also decided to demand an apology from the Prime Minister for alleging that they are supporting black money hoarders by opposing demonetization.Among various parties that attended today's meet were TMC, Left, BSP and SP, besides JD(U) and DMK. **************************************************

“Mitti mein mil jaaonga, par BJP se haath nahin milaoonga (Even if I am decimated, I will not join hands with the BJP).” This was precisely what Bihar Chief Minister and Janata Dal (United) president Nitish Kumar said when someone asked him whether there was any remote possibility of his returning to the saffron fold again.But this assertion by Nitish is in sharp contrast to some of his recent statements, particularly the stand taken by him on demonetisation of currency notes and several other critical national issues. In most of these cases, he has backed his bête noire Narendra Modi to the hilt.While the latest instance of crackdown on black money has seen Nitish joining the ranks of Modi, even as the JD (U) leader in the Rajya Sabha and former party chief Sharad Yadav has been rubbing shoulders with the likes of West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee in launching a tirade against the prime minister.The contradictory stand taken by Nitish and other senior party leaders has left the JD (U)’s rank and file perplexed. Even alliance partners like the Congress and the RJD, with whose support Nitish is running the Grand Alliance inBiharsince November 2015, appear to be at a loss while explaining about Nitish’s support to Modi.“Nitish should abide by the coalition dharma than getting carried away by Modi’s speech and backing him. In fact, Nitish is in a Catch-22 situation. He hurriedly backed Modi on demonetisation. Now after seeing the hardships faced by the common man, he must be regretting his decision. But he can’t make a U-turn now as he runs the risk of reducing himself to a laughing stock over his flip-flop approach,” argued former Union Minister and RJD vice-president Raghuvansh Prasad Singh.The Congress, whose 27 MLAs are part of the Grand Alliance, was more scathing when it issued a veiled threat to Nitish that it would take no time in pulling out of the government if he continued to back Modi on demonetisation. “We are in the government due to instruction of the Congress high command. The day we are asked to pull out of the government, we will not take a minute to do so,” said Bihar Congress president Ashok Choudhary, who is also the education minister in Nitish’s Cabinet.This was the first time that the Congress has threatened Nitish ever since he rode to power again in November 2015. Previously, Nitish has backed Modi on five occasions, thereby puzzling his supporters in particular and rest of the country in general. The first time he supported Modi was when the latter visited his Pakistani counterpart in December 2015. “There is nothing wrong in Modi visiting Nawaz Sharif’s place even if the visit was impromptu,” Nitish had then said, thereby raising many an eyebrow.Later, the JD (U) chief supported the Modi regime on the GST issue, when Congress heir apparent Rahul Gandhi was opposing the new taxation policy tooth and nail. “We had supported the Goods and Service Tax even during the UPA regime. We will continue to do so even now as I feel the GST, when implemented, will be beneficial to the states too,” Nitish opined.The third instance when Nitish backed Modi was the surgical strike where he also praised Indian defence forces. Fourth, Nitish wholeheartedly backed the PM in his fight against terrorism and asked his allies to remain united when it comes to combating extremism. Fifth, when Modi said that demonetisation was not the end but just the beginning of a series of steps he would unleash to check black money, Nitish suggested that the PM should forfeit the benami property too.On the same pageActually, Nitish aides say that he wants to be seen on the same page with Modi when it comes to fighting corruption. “After all, it’s an undeniable fact that it was Nitish who st-arted a war against corruption when he won by a landslide in the 2010 Assembly polls and started confiscating property of corrupt officers. In fact,Biharbecame the first state where government schools were opened in houses of corrupt officers which were confiscated,” a senior JD (U) leader said. “In the coming days, prior to 2019 polls, Nitish ji will harp on how it was he who started the fight against graft when he made all the babus and his ministers in Bihar to declare their assets annually,” another source said, adding that “prohibition and corruption will be two emotive issues which will dominate the 2019 polls.” But will he rake up these issues in the company of Modi or he is repositioning himself as the fulcrum of all Opposition parties who are opposed to the BJP? Or, will he eventually align with the Congress at the national level when it comes to 2019 polls?“Contrary to what is being projected in the media, Nitish and Rahul Gandhi are on the same page so far as demonetisation is concerned. Both of them have supported the government move. But what both of them have objected to is its implementation and the hardships thereby caused to the common man,” AICC spokesperson Prem Chandra Mishra toldDH.Bihar Deputy Chief Minister Tejaswi Yadav too concurs and says that the Grand Alliance is united and speaks in one voice. “We all are united in our fight against graft,” the young RJD leader averred. However, a close aide of Nitish summed it up as a “well-crafted strategy” adopted by the JD(U) strongman. “If the demonetisation move succeeds, Nitish ji can say he always supported the drive. And if it fails, he can always assert he opposed the way demonetisation was implemented without any planning. So it’s a win-win situation for him,” argued the aide.  **************************************************
