

  NEW DELHI: A minimum of 50% tax may be levied on
  unexplained bank deposits+
  made using the banned currency notes up to December 30 along with a 4-year lock in period for half of the remaining amount under the amendments to tax law the government plans to bring in Parliament shortly.
  

  However, a higher 90% tax and penalty could be imposed if assessees do not declare the unaccounted cash voluntarily.
  

  Cash deposits made using the scrapped 500 and 1000 rupee notes above a threshold that are declared to Income Tax authorities may attract 50% tax, as per the amendment to the
  Income Tax Act approved by the Cabinet+
  last night.
  

  Half of remaining deposits, or 25% of the original deposit, will not be allowed to be withdrawn for four years, top sources said.
  

  In case such deposits are not declared and are detected by tax authorities, a total of 90% tax and penalty would be charged, they said.
  

  The government had after the shock
  demonetisation+
  , given a 50-day window beginning November 10 for either depositing the 500 and 1000 rupee notes in circulation or exchanging them for new currency.
  

  While the exchange, which was limited to a maximum of Rs 2,000 per person, has been withdrawn, all old notes without any ceiling can be deposited in bank accounts.
  

  This, sources said, had led to a surge in bank deposits, particularly in zero-balance Jan Dhan accounts that swelled by over Rs 21,000 crore in just two weeks, raising suspicion that these accounts may have been used to launder black money.
  

  While the tax authorities had talked of levying a peak rate of tax and 200% penalty on top of it for any unexplained deposit above Rs 2.5 lakh during November 10 to December 30 period, it was felt that such a move may not have legal backing.
  

  To plug those loopholes, the Cabinet is believed to have yesterday approved amending the Income Tax Act by adding a clause in one of the sections to provide for the tax on an unexplained income during the window, sources said.
  

  The government plans to bring the amendment for approval during the ongoing winter session of Parliament.
  

  Sources said the demonetisation was a big step to uproot black money and corruption but its very purpose would have been defeated if the ill-gotten wealth made way into the system through benami deposits.
  

  And taxing them was a way to punish dishonest people.
  

  The tax rate however cannot be the same as charged to honest tax payers. It also could not be the 45 per cent tax and penalty charged on hereto undisclosed wealth brought to books using a one-time compliance window under the Income Disclosure Scheme (IDS) that ended on September 30.
  

  Sources said since the black money holder did not utilise the government offer to declare his ill-gotten wealth, he should pay a higher rate of tax now and curbs placed on use of that money.

  MANGALURRU: Chief Minister Siddaramaiah lashed out at central government for not responding to the letters he sent with regard to the problems of farmers and the poor who are suffering due to demonetisation.
  

  "I have shot off two letters to Finance Minister Arun Jaitley mentioning the plight of the common man, farmers and petty businessmen in the state after demonetisation. They have not taken any measures based on my letters. It is up to the central government to take measures and we have nothing to do with this issue," the CM told reporters on Saturday.
  

  He said the state government supports the central government's its fight against black money hoarders. "We have welcomed the Centre's decision. However, they should have taken adequate measures before declaring demonetization of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000. They should have printed sufficient currency for Rs 100 and Rs 500 before demonetising old notes of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000. They started the distribution of Rs 2,000 notes, but where will we get change if there is shortage of Rs 100? It is a foolish move and they have implemented in lines of 'Tughlaq Darbar'," Siddaramaiah lambasted.
  

  "Did any rich person stand in queue in front of banks and ATMs? Coolie workers, farmers and the common men are seen standing in queue for hours. The central government should have studied the problems of the common man before taking any such decision. They didn't have foresee the real impact of demonetisation that nearly 42 people died following this. The central government should give compensation to those who died during note exchange in banks and near ATMs. As a chief minister of the state, I can write a letter to the Prime Minister, Finance Minister and to the Reserve Bank of India governor. The issue is not within the purview of state government," he added.
  

  The CM said he has mentioned in his letter about the situation prevailing in private hospitals in the state after demonetization. "Many people depend on private hospitals and I have requested the centre to make provisions for private hospitals, labs and medical shops to accept old notes, but nothing has been done so far. Whatever direction state government issue in this regard does not have binding on people as the demonetization is a central government decision," Siddaramaiah said.
  

  The CM, KPCC president G Paramehswara, working president Dinesh Gundu Rao and other ministers were in Mangaluru on Saturday for 'Indira Gandhi 100', the birth centenary celebration of former Prime Ministe Indira Gandhi.

  NEW DELHI: Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal has been making some major Twitter errors lately by retweeting unverified information and then deleting it without a clarification.
  

  On Sunday, the Delhi CM retweeted - then later deleted without explanation - a misleading photograph and caption that purported to show that a man committed suicide because he faced a currency crunch due to demonetization. Later, he retweeted a picture of Syrian refugee children, with a caption that said they were children found at the site of yesterday morning's train accident near Kanpur.
  



  The Delhi CM retweeted a photograph of a man who had hung himself in Satna in Madhya Pradesh. The caption to the photograph Kejriwal retweeted said that the man who hung himself did so because he had not been able to withdraw new currency notes from the bank for four days in a row.
  

  That was patently false, as a
  TOI story
  showed.
  

  The photograph was of a man who hung himself in Satna, yes, but the reason he did so was not what the caption said, at all.
  

  The man had come to rob the bank and when he realized police had surrounded the bank and he couldn't escape, he decided to end his life. The incident took place at Allahabad Bank's Bela village branch at 3 am on Saturday.
  





  The photograph and caption were originally tweeted by one Abhishek Mishra, who appears to have deleted his account since.
  

  When Kejriwal retweeted it, he wrote in Hindi "Modiji, look at this. At least now, have some mercy on this country's people. What enmity do you have with the public?"
  


    मोदी जी, ये देखिए। अब तो इस देश के लोगों पे रहम कीजिए। आख़िर क्या दुश्मनी है आपकी जनता से। ग़रीब की इतनी हाय मत लीजिए।

  NAGPUR: Prime Minister Narendra Modi's plan to hit terrorism hard through demonetization seems to have dealt a blow to the nation's internal security threat, Naxalism, too.
  

  With intelligence and security machineries on their toes as per plan, the Naxalites will find it difficult to launder their cash dumps containing several hundred crores. They cannot transfer such substantial cash from secret locations in the forest, known only to top ranking cadres, and exchange them for new currency at banks. A section of the security forces feel that Naxalites might make a desperate attempt through Jan militia supporters, front organizations working as NGOs, and even their cadres masquerading as villagers, to launder the money in banks where they have presence.
  

  Sources in the banking sector said there have been huge deposits in Gadchiroli district. The accounts which received substantial deposits are bound to be scrutinized. Inspector general of police, state Anti-Naxal Operation (ANO) cell chief Shivaji Bodkhe said close surveillance is being kept near banks and other financial institutes in Gadchiroli, Chandrapur, Gondia and Bhandara districts.
  

  "The security forces have been alerted and checks are being conducted to intercept unaccounted cash. The banking sector too has been taken into confidence to share information about suspicious deposits and questionable flow of cash into any account," said Bodkhe.
  

  Sources in the security agencies claimed that unaccounted cash Rs1,500 crores, amassed by the Naxalites, may be left stranded as security agencies are keeping a close eye on the movements in and around the affected regions. In Central India's hinterlands, controlled by the Naxalites' Dandakaranya special zonal committee (DKSZC), it is estimated that around Rs50 crore may be at the disposal of the rebels. The cash collection from Gadchiroli, Maharashtra's most affected part in eastern Vidarbha, which is also under DKSZC, is around Rs25-30 crores.
  

  Inspector general of police, Nagpur range, Ravindra Kadam said that the demonetization would hit urban networks of Naxals adversely. "The urban cadres depend upon their rural counterpart for monetary support, which would be affected," he said. "Another problem for Naxalites is that most of their money is dumped in secret places, from where ferrying the cash at such short notice in such tight surveillance is not easy," said Kadam.
  

  Security agency sources claimed that extortion from civil contractors, traders and business houses, including mining companies, get the most party funds for Naxalites. In Gadchiroli, tendu leave collection contractors and bamboo cutters share substantial amount as funds. The Naxalites also collect party funds from tribal population through a scheme 'work-a-day' in which the rebels claim one day wage from the workers.
  

  Superintendent of police, Gadchiroli, Abhinav Deshmukh said the problems for Naxals are a logical outcome of the demonetization process. "Police are working on inputs and also conducting checks," he said.

Nagpur: According to experts, educational institutions, particularly those imparting professional education, would be severely hit by the PM's Narendra Modi's latest move to curb the black money as most of them prefer cash from the students in case, a seat is allotted under the management quota.Moreover, parents having unaccountable income also prefer the same mode. In many institutions, especially in private medical colleges, there are cash vending machines for counting of huge number of notes, as they charge about Rs1 crore-Rs 3 crore for a single MBBS or MD seat. According to parents, even colleges running courses like BA, BCom and BSc on no-grant basis, tell them to pay half amount of fees in cash. They also extort money from the students under one or other pretext like the capitation fees, building funds and others."Because of demonetization of Rs500 and Rs1000 notes, the only mode of payment in cash will be Rs100 notes. Paying fees will now result in accumulation of such a huge amount of currency that it will automatically hog limelight," feels economist Vinayak Deshpande, who is also heading Nagpur University's Business Management department.Expectedly, the college managements are not ready to come out in open about their views. However, they told TOI that their finances would be surely affected and they wouldn't have any other option than to hike the fees. The academic heads in these colleges however displayed brave face by stating that there wouldn't be any affect, as they accept the fees in cheques or demand drafts. Vice chancellor of Datta Meghe Institute of Medical Sciences (DMIMS), Dilip Gode, felt that after introduction of entrance exams like NEET, there was complete transparency in their fee structure. "Students are admitted on the basis of merit, therefore, there is no question of donations whatsoever," he said.Some authorities feel that it might get tedious for students to pay the fees as they probably won't have access to the new denominations. Principal of Ambedkar College, PC Pawar said there won't be any effect on admissions. "Demand for change will increase but overall, it's a smart move by the government which would benefit the students community ultimately in long run," he said.Some parents hailed the move stating that now the college wouldn't dare to ask them for donations in cash. "Even if they demanded, we could tell them that it won't be possible for them to carry big cash. We could even lodge a complaint against them," they said. (With inputs from Sakina Dawood)

  NEW DELHI: Demonetisation of high denomination notes "is not the end but the beginning of our deep and continuous struggle against black money", Prime Minister Narendra Modi said today addressing a BJP Parliamentary meet, PTI reported.
  

  "
  The decision+

Demonetisation means that the Reserve Bank of India has withdrawn the old currency note of certain denomination as a official mode of payment. On November 8, 2016, Prime Minister Narendra Modi in a surprise announcement said the existing higher denomination currency (Rs 500 and Rs 1000) will cease to be legal tenders. The PM said this is government's biggest push to fight black money and end corruption; he also said that those with huge amount of black money will try to kill him, but he will not take back the decision. The opposition, however, criticised the government for poor implementation of the scheme and said a lot of people have died standing in queues trying to get their hands on the new currency.The government also introduced new Rs 500 and Rs 2000 notes and urged people to move towards cash-less economy, a first for India. But the opposition has been protesting the government's decision, even stalling Parliament. A 'Jan Aakrosh Diwas' was observed by Left and other major parties, but it lost the steam due to a divided opposition.This is not the first time that demonetisation has been implemented in India. In 1936, Rs 10,000 which was the highest denomination note, was introduced but was demonetised in 1946. Though, it was re-introduced in 1954 but later, in 1978, then Prime Minister Morarji Desai in his intensive move to counter the black money, introduced The High Denomination Banks Act (Demonetisation) and declared Rs 500 , Rs 1000 and Rs 10,000 notes illegal.

  VARANASI: Continuing its campaign against demonetization, the Congress will begin a nationwide movement in the new year. The Mumbai Congress committee president Sanjay Nirupam said that the party is going to begin a nationwide campaign against demonetization from January 6.
  

  Nirupam was here on Friday to take part in the 'Sawal Satygrah' over demonetization being organised by the local unit of Congress. Talking to reporters, he said that the Congress workers will gherao the district headquarters across the country on January 6, while woman wing will come to street with beating 'thali' (plate) on January 8. The party will continue the campaign on regular basis to express its protest.
  

  He said that demonetization was an immature and foolish decision of the Prime Minister taken in haste without any proper planning. It completely failed in eradicating black money, corruption and fake currency, he said adding that so far black money worth of Rs. 4200 crore was seized for which an hefty amount of Rs. 24,000 crore was spent on printing of new currency notes. The demonetization also failed to put a check on corruption, as 30% growth in corruption was noticed in Maharashtra after scraping the higher denomination notes.
  

  He alleged that BJP leaders are involved in hoarding black money. "Not a single Congress leader was caught with black money, while 37 BJP leaders with black money to the tune of Rs. 640 crore were caught in different parts of the country. It proves their involvement in amassing black money," he said adding that the account of BJP president Amit Shah should also be checked.
  

  He further said that most of the ATMs could not be calibrated and less than 40% ATMs have cash even today. Only 5-6 lakh crore currency note are circulation against the scrapped 14.5 lakh crore notes of higher denomination. He alleged that the PM's decision destroyed the strong economy of the country, which will take years to overcome the crisis. After the failure of demonetization the PM is talking about cashless economy that will benefit the card companies, he said and added that 90% transaction is done with cash in India, while it is 80% in USA and China.
  

  "We fear that the PM will come with some similar announcement in his address to the nation on Saturday," he said adding that the government should end of withdrawal limit of money from Saturday. Besides, measures should also be taken to compensate the loss of farmers and industries during this period. The government should also take cognizance of those who died due to cash crunch during this period, he added.
  

  To a query regarding Congress and SP alliance in UP 2017 polls, he said that any decision in this regard will be taken by the party leadership only. On family feud in SP he said that it is the internal matter of SP, but the chief minister Akhilesh Yadav should come out in 'fresh air'.

  LAKHIMPUR: The ongoing currency crisis might have an impact on the bypoll to the Lakhimpur Lok Sabha seat on Saturday as majority of the voters would be likely to spend time in front of banks and ATMs instead of polling booths.
  

  Assam Pradesh Congress Committee (APCC) president Ripun Bora told TOI on Friday that demonetization had resulted in immense suffering for the people.
  

  "Demonetization has definitely affected the bypoll. Due to the currency crisis, some of the candidates could not even spend the money fixed by the Election Commission," said Bora.
  

  As many ATMs in Lakhimpur district remained closed, prospective voters looked visibly upset.
  

  "Lakhimpur's economy is largely dependent on agriculture. Many families in the district have been badly affected as this is the paddy harvesting season and there is no money to pay the labourers. Some voters of Lakhimpur who live in Guwahati and other towns will not be able to come to vote this time as they don't have the money to travel," said Hemanta Gogoi, a resident.
  

  Labaram Chetia, a trader in Lakhimpur, said arranging campaign meetings was difficult in this election as people in Lakhimpur town use cash as the most preferred mode of payment. "Let's wait for the verdict on demonetization," he added.
  

  "We will win Lakhimpur. The seat was represented by Sarbananda Sonowal till he became the chief minister this year. Lakhimpur is a matter of pride for BJP," said a party leader.

  For many, owning a home is a dis tant dream. However, events and trends taking shape now could soon turn that dream into reality.
  

  The
  government's move to clamp down on black money hoarders+
  through the
  ban on Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes+
  is expected to have a cooling effect on certain pockets of the residential market. Many developers, resellers and homebuyers insist on hard cash as a component of payment in real estate deals. Demonetisation is expected to deal a body blow to this practice. Another likely side effect is a downward pressure on the interest rate structure. This would come as a relief to people who can't afford high EMIs.
  

  Many developers are also aggressively turning towards the affordable housing segment. This opens up another avenue for those priced out of the housing market. With many states likely to enforce the Real Estate Regulatory Act, homebuyers can expect more transparency . We outline the opportunities these developments present for homebuyers.
  


    What awaits for housing?
    


  Experts believe the housing market will experience a lull in the coming months. Homebuyers can expect property prices to come down in pockets. As CARE Ratings points out in its report, developers are already grappling with slow sales, which is leading to rising inventory. Given the growing uncertainty and negative impact on demand, people are likely to postpone plans to buy property, which would increase inventory levels.Developers and sellers could be compelled to cut down prices to drive sales.
  

  Experts say the secondary market will be impacted, since it deals with a significant amount of cash. However, projects undertaken by reputed developers in the top eight Indian cities will remain more or less unaffected. This is because buyers who invest in such projects take the home loan route, and all transactions are carried out through legal channels. Home buyers can look forward to better pricing in the secondary or resale market. Excess inventory in this segment has already put a lid on prices, making possession-ready properties a more viable option for buyers.
  

  For those keen on buying directly from the developer, options might be limited. However, the demonetisation could be a boon for those looking for deals in the high-end or luxury housing segment.A large cash component is the norm in this segment. But with the government clampdown, sales are likely to dip, leading to price cuts.
  


    Home loan rates will soften
    


  Due to demonetisation, a large amount of cash in circulation will be brought within the purview of the formal banking system. Since this will reduce the dependence of banks on higher cost borrowings, they are likely to slash the marginal cost of funds based lending rate (MCLR). This will accelerate a fall in home loan interest rates, since CASA ratio is used in computing MCLR.
  

  Taking older Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes out of circulation is expected to have a longer term deflationary impact as it will bring about a slowdown in high-ticket purchases. This coupled with the adverse impact on real estate and informal sectors, may lead to slowing of GDP growth.This will probably lead to a softening in inflation, which may prompt the RBI to carry out interest rate cuts and give more leeway for banks to lower lending rates.
  


    Budget-friendly alternative
    


  In real estate, there has been a shift in demand from big ticket purchases led by investors, to purchases by end-use customers, who now constitute almost 90% of aspiring home buyers. As a result, builders are increasingly shifting their attention to the affordable housing segment. Data from Cushman & Wakefield shows the number of launches in this segment in the first half of the year has doubled from the same period last year. Affordable housing is meant for middle-income families who can spend `30-50 lakh. These are mostly located on the peripheries of the bigger cities.
  

  To keep costs under check and improve affordability, developers typically offer units in 1RK and 1BHK size, with a reduced saleable area of up to 350 square ft. for 1RKs and up to 500 square ft. for 1BHKs. The average size of affordable housing units launched in the first quarter of 2016 was reduced by 11% from those launched in the corresponding period in 2014. Many projects in this segment are coming up in the form of integrated townships, which attempt to provide maximum value for money to buyers. With more serious developers entering the segment, there has been a distinct improvement in product quality .
  


    Is it right for you?
    


  If you resent shelling out rent, but do not want to take on the burden of high EMIs, affordable housing could be your way out. The government has introduced tax benefits for the developer and homebuyer. There are also several schemes aimed at promoting publicprivate partnerships for the development of affordable housing.
  

  According to experts, affordable housing is better suited for end use, than for investment. Since the scope for price appreciation is limited, homebuyers should consider various aspects before opting for affordable housing.Only focusing on the price is a bad idea, as this can trick the buyer into investing in an inferior project, or one located in an area with little connectivity .
  

Better than renting


  Given the conditions at present, young couples who pay rent should consider buying ready-to-move-in apartments which have EMIs of up to 25% more than their monthly rent. However, it is important to ensure that the distance to their workplaces does not increase so much that it adds significantly to their monthly outflow.

  Mohit Chauhan, whose music journey began from Delhi, keeps coming to the city to meet his in-laws. We caught up with him at a story-telling festival, where he shared a bit about his days in the capital. "My career began here. I used to live in Mayur Vihar and later shifted to South Extension. I generally liked to roam around Connaught Place and Lodhi Gardens. I met my wife here. Delhi has played a pivotal role in my both personal and professional life," said the Matargashti singer. He added, "Mumbai doesn't have winters, and so having tea and spicy food here in winters is always wonderful."
  

  Mohit grew up in the hills and enjoys driving from Delhi to Himachal. While the singer was here to take a break from the hectic life of Mumbai, he felt the smog was terrible when he arrived. "Being in smoggy Delhi was a gloomy feeling. The situation has gotten better now and I hope the authorities do something about it. But, you know, the hills are the best place to go when such things happen," says Mohit, whose hometown is Nahan, Himachal Pradesh.
  

  About the side-effects of demonetization, he said, "Well, thanks to some friends who supplied me with some Rs 100 notes, I don't have to stand in the queues. But you can see that people are facing a lot of inconvenience. These days, however, I am reminded of my Delhi days, when we only had Rs 100 notes to spend! It's funny that just a few days back, we wouldn't bother about Rs 10 and Rs 20 notes, and now they are of more importance than bigger denominations!"

  GUWAHATI: The demonetization effect failed to have any impact on panwallahs and vendors in the local markets as they have chosen to swim against the tide by continuing to accept Rs 500 and Rs 1000 currency notes.
  

  These small traders, who earn their livelihood on a daily basis, shutting shop for even a day is a costly affair. "We can't afford to disrupt our daily income and need to keep doing business. We don't have too many choices for which we are accepting Rs 500 and Rs 1000 notes," said Jyoti Nath, a roadside pan shop owner.
  

  The uninterrupted trading is between the wholeseller or his selling agents and the vendors. "This morning, I needed to buy cigarettes and tobacco in bulk and I had to offer Rs 1000 notes to the wholeseller. I had no option if I had to keep my regular customers. The wholeseller, too, had to accept Rs 1000 notes as he has to sell his goods to the retailers," said Nath.
  

  Amod Singh, a vegetable-seller at the busy Ganeshguri market which is known for its rich customer base, said all the vendors in the market have taken a collective decision to accept demonetized notes till December 30. "We have the 50-day window to exchange Rs 500 and Rs 1000 notes we have received in banks. But we can't lose our customers," said Singh.
  

  The only glitch is that ATMs have not been operational for the last two days and buyers have been relatively fewer. "If people don't have any cash left with them, not even Rs 500 or Rs 1000 notes, they are helpless. But we have tried not to let down our customers," added Singh.

  AHMEDABAD: Clearly due to effects of demonetization, Gujarat witnessed a significant spurt in gold imports last month. According to records of Ahmedabad Air Cargo Complex, 18.65 metric tonne (MT) gold was imported to Gujarat in November. The imports, which were at a 20-month high, rose by 191% as compared to 6.39 MT in November 2015. In fact, gold imports have doubled as compared to October 2016, which was at 9.2 MT. "A majority of the imports took place two weeks after the demonetization move by the Union government," confirmed Samir Mankad, executive director, GSEC Ltd.
  

  The frenzy to buy gold occurred after demonetization. Piyush Bhansali, president, Choksi Mahajan, said, "Investments in gold have gone up following demonetization. While there was some speculative investments by small traders, retailers have also invested in gold in a bid to replenish stocks."
  

  Shanti Patel, president, Gems & Jewellery Trade Council, said, "Since the trading was good just ahead of Diwali, most jewellers had limited stocks. Soon after demonetization, there was a sudden spurt in gold demand, which exhausted their stocks forcing them to import more gold."
  

  "In the last one week, our sales were significantly good. This is mainly because prices went down and people had money in their bank accounts. Moreover, most jewellers have begun accepting payments online and via cheque thus aiding customers in their purchases," said Manoj Soni, a city-based jeweller.
  

  Experts, however, claim that the gold market is heading for a slowdown in the coming few months. "Till the issue of liquidity in the market is not addressed, the gold demand will be impacted," said Haresh Acharya, national secretary, Bullion Federation.

  NEW DELHI: Over-the-counter exchange of
  high value notes, which were scrapped+
  earlier this month, will stop from Friday, the government announced on Thursday. However, it also extended use of the Rs 500 note for some specific purposes up to December 15. "It has been observed that over-the-counter exchange of old currency notes of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 denominations has shown a declining trend," a finance ministry statement said after the
  government reviewed the situation+
  .
  

  "It has further been felt that people may be encouraged and facilitated to deposit their old Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes in their bank accounts. This will encourage people who are still unbanked to open bank accounts," it said.
  

  From November 25 onwards, old notes can only be deposited in banks until December 30.
  

  The government had permitted various exemptions for certain transactions and activities, such as buying cooking gas cylinders and railway tickets, payments at government hospitals, pharmacies, toll plazas and petrol pumps where payment could be made through old Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes up to November 24. It has now decided to extend the use of only the Rs 500 note for these transactions up to December 15. Use of the Rs 1,000 rupee note will not be allowed.
  

  You can also use old Rs 500 notes to pay school and college fees. These entities must be central, state government, municipality or local body schools or colleges. Old notes can also be used for pre-paid mobile topup to a limit of Rs 500.

  VARANASI: The district administration has denied permission to the Congress for a march from Shastri Ghat Varuna bridge to the district headquarters in view of model code of conduct being in force. The district Congress committee had called for the march on Saturday in protest against demonetization.
  

  As a part of Congress' nationwide agitation against demonetisation the Congressmen assembled at Shastri Ghat to take out a march. But, due to enforcement of model code of conduct, the local administration did not allow them to move in the form of procession. The Congress observer and former MLA from Haryana Kuldeep Vatsa accused the local administration of stopping them intentionally. He said that not only Congress, but the chief justice of India and President also termed demonetisation as against national interest.
  

  After denial of permission five senior leaders put the memorandum addressed to the President at the feet of the statues of Mahatma Gandhi and BR Ambedkar. "We did not want any conflict with administration, hence the memorandum was put at the feet of Gandhi and Ambedkar," said the district Congress committee president Prajanath Sharma. The programme was attended by MLA Ajay Rai, former MP Rajesh Mishra, city president Sitaram Kesari, Satish Chaubey and others.
  

  In 11-point memorandum the Congressmen sought President's intervention for the relief of people facing hardship due to demonetisation. They demanded proper compensation to those who died in lines at banks or ATMs and homage to them in Parliament. The government should make it public how much black money came after November 8, and issue a white paper on economic loss or gain due to demonetisation.
  

  The Congressmen also demanded special package for those who became jobless during this period, end of withdrawal limit, 20% bonus to the farmers on miminum support price of rabi crop, Rs, 25000 deposit to a woman of each BPL family, double wage to MGNREGA labourers, 50% subsidy to small shopkeepers and industrialist in income tax and trade tax, and special measures to address inflation due to demonetisation.

  NEW DELHI: Over-the-counter exchange of
  high value notes, which were scrapped+
  earlier this month, will stop from Friday, the government announced on Thursday. However, it also extended use of the Rs 500 note for some specific purposes up to December 15. "It has been observed that over-the-counter exchange of old currency notes of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 denominations has shown a declining trend," a finance ministry statement said after the
  government reviewed the situation+
  .

  BENGALURU: Terming the demonetization of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 currency notes by the Union government as a laudable step, the Karnataka high court on Friday dismissed a PIL against the exercise.
  
  "We are aware that in the wake of insurgencies and running of a parallel economy, which is ruining the backbone of the Indian economy , a major step was necessary . It is true there are initial problems. Any new system will have some initial problems. We don't think this is perennial. We don't find any reason to doubt the bonafides of the central government in implementing demonetization," a division bench headed by Chief Justice Subhro Kamal Mukherjee observed, while dismissing the petition filed by Mohammed Haroon Rasheed, an advocate.
  

  The petitioner, who argued in person, contended there is no reasonable classification in attempting to demonetize currency notes of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000.
  

  He also claimed a vast majority of people, who are not computer-savvy and don't know how to use the internet, are suffering.
  

  He said the notification was issued in a hurried manner without giving any intimation to the public, as the decision was announced late evening on November 8 and the ban came into effect from November 9 midnight.
  

  Prabhuling K Navadagi, additional solicitor general (Karnataka high court) appearing on behalf of the Union government, informed the court that demonetization was a laudable initiative and undertaken as large volumes of fake currency , acting as a parallel economy, are ruining the country and the authorities thought it fit to tackle the situation through demonetization.
  

  People with money they can account for are facing no difficulties, while those with unaccounted money without any valid explanations, would suffer, Navadgi added.

  AHMEDABAD: Clearly due to effects of demonetization, Gujarat witnessed a significant spurt in gold imports last month. According to records of Ahmedabad Air Cargo Complex, 18.65 metric tonne (MT) gold was imported to Gujarat in November. The imports, which were at a 20-month high, rose by 191% as compared to 6.39 MT in November 2015. In fact, gold imports have doubled as compared to October 2016, which was at 9.2 MT. "A majority of the imports took place two weeks after the demonetization move by the Union government," confirmed Samir Mankad, executive director, GSEC Ltd.
  

  The frenzy to buy gold occurred after demonetization. Piyush Bhansali, president, Choksi Mahajan, said, "Investments in gold have gone up following demonetization. While there was some speculative investments by small traders, retailers have also invested in gold in a bid to replenish stocks."
  

  Shanti Patel, president, Gems & Jewellery Trade Council, said, "Since the trading was good just ahead of Diwali, most jewellers had limited stocks. Soon after demonetization, there was a sudden spurt in gold demand, which exhausted their stocks forcing them to import more gold."
  

  "In the last one week, our sales were significantly good. This is mainly because prices went down and people had money in their bank accounts. Moreover, most jewellers have begun accepting payments online and via cheque thus aiding customers in their purchases," said Manoj Soni, a city-based jeweller.
  

  Experts, however, claim that the gold market is heading for a slowdown in the coming few months. "Till the issue of liquidity in the market is not addressed, the gold demand will be impacted," said Haresh Acharya, national secretary, Bullion Federation.

  AHMEDABAD /RAJKOT: Even as currency supply to several banks was replenished, the majority of banks are pinning hopes on the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to continue improved supply of notes so that they can cater to their customers during 'pay days'- usually first 10 days of a month. Demand for cash continued to be higher than the supply resulting in long queues.
  

  Although the supply from the central bank was better than in previous week, bankers admitted a rise in demand for cash. As the banks opened after a gap of two days, long queues were spotted outside branches since early morning. At many banks in Satellite, Jodhpur, Vastrapur, Navrangpura and Naranpura, tokens were distributed during first rounds to avoid heavy rush of people.
  

  As the banks downed their shutters before 3 pm, the burden shifted to ATMs, many of those money vending machines ran out of cash within two hours.
  

  "The supply of currency notes from the central bank is better than the previous week. However, the demand for cash from consumers has also increased at the same time," said a branch manager of a nationalized bank.
  

  When asked about their preparedness to tackle the rush during 'pay days', a senior bank official said,"It all depends on the supply on currency notes from the RBI."
  

  "Our head office has asked us to assess the demand likely to be created during the pay days and provide figures of the amount required," said a banker.
  

  Banking sector sources also revealed that they have been informed that large number of new currency notes were printed on Saturday and Sunday, when banks were closed. The same would be made available to them so that they can handle restive customers.
  

  After a two-day holiday, banks across Saurashtra opened to scenes of chaos as cash-strapped people scrambled to get money, mostly in vain. Citizens, many of them aged and ill, fumed as they did not get enough money despite the central government permitting withdrawal of Rs 24,000 by cheque.
  

  Arvind Patel, 35, a resident of Raiya Road in Rajkot, desperately needed money to get his leg operated. "Ever since the Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes became invalid, the Bank of Baroda ATM at Raiya Road is closed. I visited the bank on three working days, but have not got a single rupee," said Patel, who works as a driver.
  

  Due to lack of adequate supply from RBI, many banks in Rajkot city ran out of cash within hours of opening in the morning. "We received Rs 10 lakh last Thursday. So, we are able to give only up to Rs 4,000 to each account holder," said Narendrasinh Jadeja, managing director at Jeevan Commercial Bank, Rajkot.
  

  The situation is particularly grim in rural Saurashtra where farmers are finding it difficult to withdraw cash and even sell their produce in the market because of the cash crunch.

  PUNE: There has been a 37% decline in property registrations across the state since the demonetization of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 currency notes.
  

  As per the inspector general of registration and controller of stamps, from an average of 7,299 documents per day from August to October, the number has come down to around 4,588 since the demonetization move — from November 9 to 15.
  

  The IGR registered a total of 4.89 lakh documents in the three-month period (August-October), averaging around 7,299 registrations per day. The revenue for this period stood at Rs 1,410.91 crore, averaging about Rs 64.13 crore per day. For the month of November so far, the revenue collection has been Rs 281.85 crore, averaging about Rs 31.22 crore per day, the IGR stated.
  

  "A comparative analysis of the last three-month period and the one after the demonetization shows a 37% decrease in daily registrations," IGR N Ramaswami told TOI.
  

  Officials from the state department of registration and stamps attributed the dip in numbers to the component of cash demanded by the builders. "While 98% of the cash to be given to the IGR is paid online, the document handling charges too have been allowed via demand draft. Considering this, the decrease in registrations is not because of the department, but due to the cash component demanded by the builders," the officials said.
  

  Property investors said buyers are delaying registrations ever since the Centre announced the demonetization of high denomination currency notes.
  

  Amit Shah of Wadgaon Budruk, who was scheduled to register his flat on November 10, has delayed it by a month. "The demonetization move has left me cashless. Now, I will register my house some other time," he said.
  

  Sherna Vakil of Kondwa, another buyer, had entered into talks with a leading developer for registration last week. However, he too has to postpone the property registration by a fortnight. "I know the entire process is by cheque, but there is so much confusion regarding the demonetization and hardly any cash in hand to go ahead with the registration," she added.
  

  Developers too observed a dip in registration due to the sudden demonetization move. Credai vice-president, Pune Rohit Gera said there are different segments in the realty sector which involve cash components, especially in the luxury segment. "The dip in registrations in the last four days is mainly due to the cash crunch, prompting people to postpone property registrations," Gera said. However, steps should be taken by the state government to ensure that there are no cash payments involved in property registrations to clean the system, he added.
  

  "There is a need to check on the number of approvals given before the demonetization move," Gera suggested.

  BAREILLY: Two days after the Supreme Court expressed the fear that the currency crisis triggered by demonetization might lead to riots in the country, incidents in Uttar Pradesh seem to bear it out, according to senior police officials in the state who are trying to deal with incidents of mob violence at banks and on roads. From bank employees locked up in their office by an irate crowd in Shamli, to vandalism and assault of security guards in Baghpat and roads blocked in Sambhal, Moradabad and Saharanpur, public anger is turning to violence. Police have been alerted across the region and the situation is tense.
  

  On Friday, a bench comprising Chief Justice of India T S Thakur and Justice A R Dave refused to stop high courts across the country from entertaining petitions challenging the Centre's demonetization notification, saying that people were seriously affected and doors of courts could not be shut "in a situation which may lead to riots".
  

  On condition of anonymity, a senior state police official told TOI that disturbing inputs were being received from every corner of several districts that incidents which could lead to riot-like situations were occurring. "We are on high alert as anti-social elements may take advantage of such situations to spread panic among the citizens. Adequate force has been deployed at every bank branch to avoid any awkward situation as frustration is mounting among citizens who have been queueing up for days," the official added.
  

  A frustrated crowd of customers of Union Bank of India in Saharanpur blocked the Delhi-Yamunotri highway in Behat town. The bank branch is situated on the highway. The crowd blocked traffic after the bank manager refused to dispense Rs 2.5 lakh each to customers who had arrived carrying wedding cards of their children. Citizens alleged that the manager told them that he had received no such order from his regional office. Police arrived at the spot and tried to reason with the crowd, while traffic was blocked for more than two hours.
  

  In Thanabhavan town of Shamli district, customers locked the staff of Union Bank of India inside the branch after cash ran out. The people alleged the bank disbursed notes for only half-an-hour. Police had to intervene there as well. A similar situation occurred at SBI's Hasanpur Luhari branch in Shamli's Jalalabad town.
  

  In Baghpat district, at a branch of SBI, a crowd of annoyed customers vandalised the office and scuffled with staff, assaulting security guards. Branch manager M K Khuran said the "misunderstanding" was eventually sorted out.
  

  In Sambhal district, women blocked the highway after the Pratham Bank branch at Pavansa ran out of cash. Police was forced to exchange currency notes with the crowd from their own pockets to clear the road.
  

  "I myself exchanged Rs 6,000 with about a dozen women to make them clear the highway," said Pavansa police picket in-charge Balram Singh Yadav.
  

  At Kundarki and Jatpura branches of Bank of India and Punjab National Bank respectively in rural Moradabad, public rage erupted after the branches did not have cash for two successive days. The crowds stopped traffic there as well.
  

  Station officer Prempal Singh Yadav said, "We are keep an eye on all such incidents just in case there are anti-social elements involved rather than genuine aggrieved customers."
  

  BOI's Kundarki branch manager Lalit Kumar said no cash had been sent to them for two days despite repeated requests and there was little his staff could do about it.

  VARANASI: How the voters react to demonetization in UP 2017 polls will be clear only after the election results, but the records of the past Assembly elections present a picture of mixed colours in different constituencies in urban and rural areas of Varanasi, which is today represented by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Lok Sabha.
  

  It will be second general election of UPs Legislative Assembly after the delimitation in 2008. Before delimitation, the district had six Assembly constituencies including Varanasi Cantt, Varanasi South, Varanasi North, Kolasla, Chiraigaon and Gangapur. And after delimitation, there are eight constituencies - Varanasi Cantt, Varanasi South, Varanasi North, Pindra, Ajagara (R), Shivpur, Rohaniya and Sevapuri. Three old constituencies lost their existence, while five new constituencies emerged after delimitation.
  

  While the urban area constituencies Varanasi Cantt, Varanasi South and Varanasi North had been dominated by Bharatiya Janata Party, the rural and semi-urban constituencies, before delimitations Chiraigaon, Kolasla and Gangapur, were dominated by Congress and left parties.
  

  Before delimitation the parties like Bahujan Samaj Party, Samajwadi Party and Apna Dal also emerged successful in Chiraigaon and Gangapur in 2007 and 2002 elections. However Kolasla was ruled by the Communist Party of India for eight times followed by BJP (3) and Congress (2).
  

  In 2012 election after delimitation, AD opened its account in Rohaniya constituency with the victory of Anupriya Patel. Later, the SP's Mahendra Patel bagged this seat after Anupriya was elected to Lok Sabha in 2014.
  

  The BSP won Ajagara and Shivpur seats in 2012 election, but it expelled its Shivpur MLA Uday Lal Maurya from the party in recent past. Pindra seat was won by Congress Ajay Rai, who had won Kolasla seat for three times in a row on BJP ticket from 1996 to 2007. The three urban seats Varanasi Cantt, Varanasi South and Varanasi North showed different character.
  

  According to records, the Cantt seat was represented by BJP for six times from 1991 to 2012, and earlier Bharatiya Jana Sangh in 1967. The Congress won this seat twice, while it was also represented by Bharatiya Kranti Dal, Janata Party, Janata Dal and Lok Dal.
  

  The Varanasi South seat has also been a citadel of BJP since 1989 with continuous seven victories, while Jana Sangh had also won the seat in the past for two times. The socialist leader Raj Narain had won this seat for the first time in 1951, but lost to Sampurnanand of Congress. The Congress won this seat for five times. The one time winners of this seat were CPI and Janata Party. Similarly, the Varanasi North seat was won by BJP and Jana Sangh for six times, while Congress registered its victory for six times. The SP candidates won this seat for four time from 1996 to 2007.

  NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi today likened demonetisation to a Hindu 'yagna' or sacrifice.
  

  In a series of tweets, the PM again defended his decision to scrap high value currency, but this time focussed on its benefit for rural India and wage labourers, the people who have been the most affected by the cash crunch .
  

  The PM also made a mention of "a degree of inconvenience" due to the scrapping of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes and said that it was something he had alerted the country to and that "this short term pain will pave way for long term gains."
  

  "I salute the people of India for wholeheartedly participating in this ongoing Yagna against corruption, terrorism & black money," he said.
  

  His focus though was on what he called "the backbone of the nation" that is farmers, traders and labourers.
  

  "The Government's decision has several gains for farmers, traders, labourers, who are the economic backbone of our nation. No longer will the progress and prosperity of rural India be curtailed by corruption and black money. Our villages must get their due," Modi said.
  

  The PM also called demonetisation "a historic opportunity" to move to a cashless, technologically-advanced India.
  

  "My young friends, you are agents of change who will make India corruption free and ensure more cashless transactions. Together, we must ensure India defeats black money. This will empower the poor, neo-middle class, middle class & benefit future generations,"he said.

  NEW DELHI: Unfazed by criticism of the
  demonetisation move+
  , Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on Friday said replacing 86 per cent of the currency in circulation with new bank notes could not have been executed in a better way than currently being implemented.
  

  Ten days after the government
  withdrew 1,000 and 500 rupee notes+
  , he said the move will help banks lend at a cheaper rate to businesses, trade, agriculture and infrastructure while at the same time getting rid of the shadow economy.
  

  "On the execution part, I don't think this could have been better executed than how it has been executed now," he said at an ET Now event here.
  

  He said replacing such a large currency without any social unrest and any significant economic disruption was an "achievement".
  

  "When currency replacement takes place, initial inconvenience takes place, but there is not a single major incident in the country. It's moving smoothly as everyday passes by. The queues are getting smaller," he said.
  

  "In the next 1-2 weeks, we have to make sure currency reaches rural areas because that is where it's required. This is the largest currency exchange in the world probably in recent times."
  

  Indian shopkeepers, traders and retailers, according to Jaitley, will realise that formal official trade is certainly superior way of doing business than just a shadow economy.
  

  "It has its own pitfalls. And therefore by this shock therapy, everybody enters into cleaner system of economy. In the long run, it will be welcome by all," he said.
  

  Stating that there is not any parallel of such a large decision in Indian history in several decades that was ethically and morally so correct, he said every honest man felt that he had no reason to be worried.
  

  The decision has "popular support because there were people with crime money, black money or wealth accumulated by not paying taxes".
  

  Stating that high denomination currency has ceased to be a legal tender, Jaitley admitted that some more legal steps will be required later on if one is to extinguish that.
  

  "It is important to realise what was the Indian normal for last 70 years. It had almost become the Indian normal to have a parallel economy, to have a shadow economy. It was almost a way of life," he said.
  

  With large currencies in circulation outside the banking system and a narrow tax base, banks were "becoming challenged if not vulnerable".
  

  "And I think it's not the normal in which we are functioning. This one decision now redefines the Indian normal, there is a new Indian normal," he asserted.
  

  The finance minister also made a point that just as the telecom revolution which had not been envisaged in India but took place, the new normal is going to be different 5-8 years down the road.
  

  "We are going to live in an entirely different kind of an economy," he said.
  

  On big challenges Indian economy faced, Jaitley pointed to the limited ability of banks to support growth because of NPAs and their "lending abilities are suspect".
  

  He also spoke of the private sector not bringing in investment, which is being compounded by a global slowdown.
  

  "Now let's see the impact of this decision in medium and long term. It has suddenly pushed up the ability of banks to lend at a cheaper rate. The ability of the Indian banking system to support growth, support economy, support growth economy had become extremely doubtful," he remarked.
  

  Banks, he said, are suddenly flush with all low-cost funds. "So, these low-cost funds are going to be lent to businesses, trade, agriculture, infrastructure at a much lower rate today. And the private sector, which was feeling stressed, this has a direct impact," the finance minister added.
  

  "In the long term, it is going to change the way traders trade, how we manage the household budget. It would bring more transactions into the banking system, we have a cleaner and bigger economy, a bigger taxation system -- and this one decision redefines the Indian new normal."

  The Prime Minister Narendra Modi's decision of demonetizing Rs 1000 and Rs 500 notes -the two highest currency denominations in India -is a historic effort to sweep up the decades old parallel economy. The decision by the government will surely prove a milestone for the Indian economy in the long run. As India is poised to become one of the fastest economies, this move will surely bring a bigger, bet ter and clear picture in the franchise industry as well.
  

The demon in demonetizing: a short-term nightmare


  In the short term, demon etizing, without any doubt, will be a nightmare for a lot of consumer business activity, but see the brighter side, in the long run; it would have more business benefits. The service sector, which domi nates economic activity and involves a sizable chunk of cash transactions, will hit the hardest. The most affected businesses are where transaction was Rs 1000, or within, and most people would not find it worth using a card for it.Whether it is a store, or an e-commerce platform, a fall in discretionary consumption will hurt companies operating in this space.The fall in economic activity due to demonetization could last from two to three quarters.
  

The bigger picture


  Finance Minister Arun Jaitley recently shared, "The goal of this is to clean transactions, (to) clean money." The size of the organized economy, which the government will manage though its policy actions, would increase and would be significant in the coming months. The franchise industry will see a lot of positive impact on its growth in the coming year with more investments flowing into the franchise businesses, better franchise financing through banks, a move towards digitization and cashless economy that would be faster in the franchise industry because of its transparent operational structure, and finally it will bring more competitive en vironment for franchisees to conduct their business against traders, small and mom-n pop businesses.
  

Shift in investment activity:


  Demonetization will be an eye-opener for majority, who believed in savings and doing passive investment on cash, real estate, and gold jewelry.Since the announcement, the real estate prices and equity stocks have dipped by almost 30 per cent.Gold deposits over 500 gram, not explained by known source of income, will also attract income tax under the gold monetization scheme.
  

  Franchising can play a bigger role in this. People will now become wary of holding cash reserves; rather they would want to pump investments into a franchise business, which could give them good and clean ROI. This will open up new avenues for women, retired, young, who would be excited to park their capital into a franchise holding. According to an estimate by The Franchise World, the franchise investment could grow Rs 500-600 crores by quarter three of 2017.
  

Franchise businesses will become competitive:


  Small businesses like kirana and mom-and-pop stores by and large had cash transactions, which allowed them to get away with the paying taxes by not showing their real record. This made franchise businesses less profitable as compared to small-unorganized businesses, which have to re port and keep business management fair and transparent as per the rules of the franchising model. Demonetization will make franchise business more competitive as they are already compliant and organized and this time they would be able to up their game against the unorganized mom-and-pop stores.
  


    More funds and easy lending to organized businesses:
    


  Post-demonetization, the Indian banks have seen a considerable rise in deposits of around Rs 5 trillion till 18 November 2016. Banks are already reducing their lending rates and with lower interest rates on existing floating rate loans and new loans, it means franchise businesses will be able to take an advantage of small business loans and start-up loans from banks that were not available earlier. Banks might tie up with credible franchisors and franchise brands to fund their fran chisees' business needs.Lower interest rates should, all else being equal, produce a stimulus to the economy.
  


    Better digitization in franchise ecosystem:
    


  Franchise systems are by and large big brands and organizational entities. Collectively the brand has more financial and operational muscle to carry out new technological and digitization changes that new Indian ecosystem will need in order to create a cashless economy. Indian franchisees are more aware, exposed and forward thinking to take changes in their stride and actively bring about transformation that would make their franchise a better system to do business for the ease of consumer.The resilience and the come through into a new business ecosystem will be the fastest by the franchise industry under this new cashless regime.

  AHMEDABAD: Demonetization has not only affected the common businessman, but drug dealers too. A drug dealer was arrested on Thursday with 3 kg charas, valued at Rs20 lakh in the open market, from Sabarmati railway station. He told officials of the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB), Ahmedabad, that he had tried to cash in on the shortage in supply of charas brought about by demonetization .
  

  Hariom Gandhi, the zonal director of NCB, said the accused, Sayed Alimuddin, 60, had said his regular customers had forced him to procure an immediate consignment, as demonetization had dried up drug supply. The accused also told NCB officials that he had planned to procure 12kg-15kg charas from Kashmir via Delhi, looking at the shortage, but he could not owing to cash crunch caused by demonetization. Gandhi said acting on a tip-off officials of NCB intercepted Alimuddin, a resident of Gomtipur. On checking his belongings, the officials found 3kg of charas. Gandhi said that during interrogation it was revealed that Alimuddin had received the contraband from Delhi and was supplied by one Bashir who is based in Jammu and Kashmir. He also told NCB officials that he could only pay half the amount to Bashir and purchased the rest on credit.

  MUMBAI: The impact of demonetization of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 currency notes on the residential real estate segment will see a limited impact in larger cities, though some tier 2 and tier 3 cities where cash components have been a factor, even in primary sales will see a business crunch, states a JLL India report.
  

  "The secondary or resale market will, however, certainly be impacted, given the fact that this segment does see the involvement of cash component,'' it said.
  

  The commercial real estate will see minimum impact on office/industrial leasing and transactions business, given that cash components do not play a significant role in such transactions.
  

  The report said that in real estate investment markets, projects could get stretched as informal sources of capital may not be available. "This, in fact, spells more opportunities for institutional capital. FDI, private equity and debt players will suddenly find the market even more transparent and attractive. Moreover, banks could start funding land transactions, thereby decelerating land prices,'' said JLL country head Anuj Puri.
  

  However, retailers could see some impact on their business in the short-to-medium term due to reduced cash transactions. The luxury segment is likely to be hit because of the historically high incidence of black money acceptance in this segment. However, credit/debit cards and e-Wallets should come to the rescue. Overall, the domestic consumption story remains intact, with no threat to the overall strength and growth of the Indian retail industry.

  NEW DELHI: Money being flown from Haryana to
  Nagaland+
  might seem like a truly bizarre way of trying to convert stashes of cash in
  old notes into legal tender+
  , but it's not as illogical as it might sound. India's income tax laws allow exemptions for various categories of incomes or individuals. These exemptions are apparently now being misused to covert black cash into white money.
  

  Among those exempt from paying income tax are members of scheduled tribe communities in Nagaland, Manipur, Tripura, Arunachal Pradesh and Mizoram. Scheduled tribes in North Cachar Hills and Mikir Hills in Assam, the Khasi Hills, Garo Hills and Jaintia Hills in Meghalaya and Ladakh in Jammu & Kashmir also don't have to pay income tax. The exemption applies to income arising from any source in these areas or from dividends or interest on securities from anywhere.
  

  A similar exemption is available to all those defined as "Sikkimese" in the I-T Act. This again is for any income generated from Sikkim itself and for income from dividend or interest on securities generated anywhere. The intent behind these exemptions is to provide fiscal concessions to backward areas and communities. In times like now, it becomes a useful route for people looking to turn undisclosed incomes legitimate.
  

  Apart from these geographically restricted exemptions, there is of course the exemption for agricultural income. That includes any rent or revenue derived from agricultural land. There are several institutions that are tax exempt under the IT Act. Again, it is not difficult to see why the lawmakers would have decided not to tax them. For instance, income of a public charitable trust or not for profit society established for development of khadi and village industries is exempt from tax. Educational institutions including universities existing solely for educational purposes and not for profit are exempt from paying tax on their incomes under various sub-sections of the IT Act.
  

  Similarly, not for profit hospitals too are exempt, different kinds being covered by different sub-sections.
  

  Income of a charitable institution or fund approved by the prescribed authority is not required to pay taxes on its income either. Nor are public religious or public charitable trusts approved by the prescribed authority. Political parties and electoral trusts are also exempt from tax on their incomes. It is another matter that a major chunk of the money flowing to parties never enters any books anyway.

  AHMEDABAD: Sharda Jhala, a farm labourer from Aravalli district, stares at an uncertain future. Work has dried up after demonetization, and she has got work for barely 20 days at half wages for Rs100 per day. With no money to pay for auto fare to school, her son sits at home. What has rattled Sharda the most is the fact that she is forced to make her family subsist on just one meal a day -- a bajri rotla, some onion and chilli.
  

  "My husband can't work, and I am the sole breadwinner of the family," says Sharda. "I had taken a loan recently to buy a cow. With livelihood becoming uncertain, I've cut the food even for the animal."
  

  "We eat once a day with the resources we have - bajra (pearl millet) and onion or chilli. I hope the situation improves, or else we will be forced to starve," Sharda added.
  

  In his 'Mann ki Baat' on December 25, PM Narendra Modi had emphasized that cashless transactions will help ending exploitation of informal sector workers, while enumerating benefits of demonetization and moving to cashless economy.
  

  The long-term benefits of the move are yet to unfold, but thousands of unorganized workers, especially women, have become 'cashless' in the literal sense.
  

  The poor are yet to recover from the body blow delivered by demonetization and are forced to take drastic measures to survive, such as skipping meals, or pulling out their children from schools, shaking the very base of our society.
  

  Valji Garasar, 51, a daily wager in Amraiwadi, says his family is staring at starvation as he managed to get work for just two days out of past 50 days. "I earned only Rs 750 post notebandi," said Garasar. "I can barely feed my three children. I tried in vain to look for some other work. I pray things to improve else we will be forced to starve,"
  

  Harjeevan Dhulera, 60, a construction labourer and father of three says he, too, found work only for three days in the past 50 days. "With no money, my children and I survive on free meals at Chakudia Mahadev temple," said Dhulera.
  

  Shanta Parmar, a vegetable vendor at Jamalpur market and mother of three, including a special child, says her income has dropped by 65% after demonetization.
  

  "My daily income has drastically come down to Rs150 per day from Rs 500 - Rs600 before notebandi. I can no longer afford to send my hearing-impaired daughter to school," said Parmar.
  

  "I am barely able to place one decent meal a day before my family of five persons," says Shanta who concedes she considers herself lucky when she compares herself with neighbours contemplating to return to their native villages.
  

  Manju Gohel, a waste-picker in Gheekanta says that over 100 women in the work have been rendered virtually jobless for the past fortnight.
  

  "The distressed cloth market itself is generating less paper and scrap material, while scrap dealers have slashed prices by half," said Gohel.
  

  "With earnings now below Rs 50 on most days, it is tough to decide whether I should afford Rs 60 - Rs70 each day to go to work, or simply accept my loss and sit at home," says Manju.
  

  Bharti Chauhan, a construction worker from Behrampura, said that many of her co-workers have taken up jobs as domestic help or cooking assistants in marriages to keep their home hearths burning.

  VARANASI: How the voters react to demonetization in UP 2017 polls will be clear only after the election results, but the records of the past Assembly elections present a picture of mixed colours in different constituencies in urban and rural areas of Varanasi, which is today represented by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Lok Sabha.
  

  It will be second general election of UPs Legislative Assembly after the delimitation in 2008. Before delimitation, the district had six Assembly constituencies including Varanasi Cantt, Varanasi South, Varanasi North, Kolasla, Chiraigaon and Gangapur. And after delimitation, there are eight constituencies - Varanasi Cantt, Varanasi South, Varanasi North, Pindra, Ajagara (R), Shivpur, Rohaniya and Sevapuri. Three old constituencies lost their existence, while five new constituencies emerged after delimitation.
  

  While the urban area constituencies Varanasi Cantt, Varanasi South and Varanasi North had been dominated by Bharatiya Janata Party, the rural and semi-urban constituencies, before delimitations Chiraigaon, Kolasla and Gangapur, were dominated by Congress and left parties.
  

  Before delimitation the parties like Bahujan Samaj Party, Samajwadi Party and Apna Dal also emerged successful in Chiraigaon and Gangapur in 2007 and 2002 elections. However Kolasla was ruled by the Communist Party of India for eight times followed by BJP (3) and Congress (2).
  

  In 2012 election after delimitation, AD opened its account in Rohaniya constituency with the victory of Anupriya Patel. Later, the SP's Mahendra Patel bagged this seat after Anupriya was elected to Lok Sabha in 2014.
  

  The BSP won Ajagara and Shivpur seats in 2012 election, but it expelled its Shivpur MLA Uday Lal Maurya from the party in recent past. Pindra seat was won by Congress Ajay Rai, who had won Kolasla seat for three times in a row on BJP ticket from 1996 to 2007. The three urban seats Varanasi Cantt, Varanasi South and Varanasi North showed different character.
  

  According to records, the Cantt seat was represented by BJP for six times from 1991 to 2012, and earlier Bharatiya Jana Sangh in 1967. The Congress won this seat twice, while it was also represented by Bharatiya Kranti Dal, Janata Party, Janata Dal and Lok Dal.
  

  The Varanasi South seat has also been a citadel of BJP since 1989 with continuous seven victories, while Jana Sangh had also won the seat in the past for two times. The socialist leader Raj Narain had won this seat for the first time in 1951, but lost to Sampurnanand of Congress. The Congress won this seat for five times. The one time winners of this seat were CPI and Janata Party. Similarly, the Varanasi North seat was won by BJP and Jana Sangh for six times, while Congress registered its victory for six times. The SP candidates won this seat for four time from 1996 to 2007.

  GUWAHATI: The BJP attributed its two byelection victories in the state on Tuesday to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's demonization effect saying that 'jihad' against black money has been accepted by people of the state.
  

  Six months ago, the saffron party thrashed Congress to win its first assembly election in the state riding on illegal migrants issue, which has been a tried and tested election winning subject every election.
  

  BJP had scripted a similar success story in the Lok Sabha election in 2014 in Assam with the same issue.
  

  The two b-poll victories in Lakhimpur Lok Sabha and Baithalangsu assembly constituencies have come at a time when the BJP governments both at the centre and state have been drawing flak over the Centre's proposal to amend the Citizenship Act to convert illegal Hindu Bangladeshi migrants to Indian citizens. BJP claims this issue was overshadowed by the storm created by the mega demonetization exercise.
  

  Chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal, after meeting Modi earlier in the the day in New Delhi, said, "Prime Minister Narendra Modi has unleashed a jihad against corruption and people of Assam have approved the stand taken by the PM in regard to demonization of Rs 500 and Rs 1000 notes. The mandate signifies people's faith in the efforts of the present dispensation for bringing a tangible change in their lives."
  

  Taking a dig at Congress, Sonowal said, "Congress tried to misguide the people of Assam but failed miserably. All sections of people in Assam have supported the PM. I believe that the situation is same across the country. I think Congress should go to the people instead of trying to misguide the people.

  HUBBALLI: While many firms and business establishments suffered huge losses after the demonetisation of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes,loutlets in the district still have their spirits high. More than 47,000 litres of liquor were sold in the district in December, registering an increase of 50-60% over the corresponding month in 2015.
  

  Hubballi, the second largest commercial hub of the state, has already reported a loss of about Rs 100-150 crore in various trades after demonetization.
  

  According to sources in the excise department, the district has nearly 255 liquor outlets, including bars and restaurants, retail shops and bars. In 2015-16, the sale of liquor stood at 10,67,859 litres (1,18,651 cases) and in 2016-17, it stood at 11,15109 litres (1,23,901 cases) in the months of December. Overall, the district registered an increase of 47,250 litres (5,250 cases) of Indian Made Liquor (IML) during the New Year celebrations with the sale growing by 50-60% on December 30 and 31, said excise department officials.
  

  Sources said that beer consumption has come down. In 2015-16, the district registered a sale of 5,59,251 litres (62,139 cases) and in 2016-17, it dipped to 4,98,681 litres (55,409 cases) in December. Of the beer sold, 60% was during the New Year celebrations.
  

  Speaking to TOI, Ramesh Kyatannavar, deputy commissioner, excise department, Dharwad, said that the assumption of decrease in the sale of liquor due to demonetization has proved to be wrong. "Demonetization has not affected the consumption of liquor and the sale registered a growth during the New Year celebrations. But the sale of beer has come down this time around. A slight increase in the price of beer and rising cold wave might have discouraged many to go for beer," said Kyatannavar.

  NAGPUR: Prime Minister Narendra Modi's plan to hit terrorism hard through demonetization seems to have dealt a blow to the nation's internal security threat, Naxalism, too.
  

  With intelligence and security machineries on their toes as per plan, the Naxalites will find it difficult to launder their cash dumps containing several hundred crores. They cannot transfer such substantial cash from secret locations in the forest, known only to top ranking cadres, and exchange them for new currency at banks. A section of the security forces feel that Naxalites might make a desperate attempt through Jan militia supporters, front organizations working as NGOs, and even their cadres masquerading as villagers, to launder the money in banks where they have presence.
  

  Sources in the banking sector said there have been huge deposits in Gadchiroli district. The accounts which received substantial deposits are bound to be scrutinized. Inspector general of police, state Anti-Naxal Operation (ANO) cell chief Shivaji Bodkhe said close surveillance is being kept near banks and other financial institutes in Gadchiroli, Chandrapur, Gondia and Bhandara districts.
  

  "The security forces have been alerted and checks are being conducted to intercept unaccounted cash. The banking sector too has been taken into confidence to share information about suspicious deposits and questionable flow of cash into any account," said Bodkhe.
  

  Sources in the security agencies claimed that unaccounted cash Rs1,500 crores, amassed by the Naxalites, may be left stranded as security agencies are keeping a close eye on the movements in and around the affected regions. In Central India's hinterlands, controlled by the Naxalites' Dandakaranya special zonal committee (DKSZC), it is estimated that around Rs50 crore may be at the disposal of the rebels. The cash collection from Gadchiroli, Maharashtra's most affected part in eastern Vidarbha, which is also under DKSZC, is around Rs25-30 crores.
  

  Inspector general of police, Nagpur range, Ravindra Kadam said that the demonetization would hit urban networks of Naxals adversely. "The urban cadres depend upon their rural counterpart for monetary support, which would be affected," he said. "Another problem for Naxalites is that most of their money is dumped in secret places, from where ferrying the cash at such short notice in such tight surveillance is not easy," said Kadam.
  

  Security agency sources claimed that extortion from civil contractors, traders and business houses, including mining companies, get the most party funds for Naxalites. In Gadchiroli, tendu leave collection contractors and bamboo cutters share substantial amount as funds. The Naxalites also collect party funds from tribal population through a scheme 'work-a-day' in which the rebels claim one day wage from the workers.
  

  Superintendent of police, Gadchiroli, Abhinav Deshmukh said the problems for Naxals are a logical outcome of the demonetization process. "Police are working on inputs and also conducting checks," he said.

Nagpur: According to experts, educational institutions, particularly those imparting professional education, would be severely hit by the PM's Narendra Modi's latest move to curb the black money as most of them prefer cash from the students in case, a seat is allotted under the management quota.Moreover, parents having unaccountable income also prefer the same mode. In many institutions, especially in private medical colleges, there are cash vending machines for counting of huge number of notes, as they charge about Rs1 crore-Rs 3 crore for a single MBBS or MD seat. According to parents, even colleges running courses like BA, BCom and BSc on no-grant basis, tell them to pay half amount of fees in cash. They also extort money from the students under one or other pretext like the capitation fees, building funds and others."Because of demonetization of Rs500 and Rs1000 notes, the only mode of payment in cash will be Rs100 notes. Paying fees will now result in accumulation of such a huge amount of currency that it will automatically hog limelight," feels economist Vinayak Deshpande, who is also heading Nagpur University's Business Management department.Expectedly, the college managements are not ready to come out in open about their views. However, they told TOI that their finances would be surely affected and they wouldn't have any other option than to hike the fees. The academic heads in these colleges however displayed brave face by stating that there wouldn't be any affect, as they accept the fees in cheques or demand drafts. Vice chancellor of Datta Meghe Institute of Medical Sciences (DMIMS), Dilip Gode, felt that after introduction of entrance exams like NEET, there was complete transparency in their fee structure. "Students are admitted on the basis of merit, therefore, there is no question of donations whatsoever," he said.Some authorities feel that it might get tedious for students to pay the fees as they probably won't have access to the new denominations. Principal of Ambedkar College, PC Pawar said there won't be any effect on admissions. "Demand for change will increase but overall, it's a smart move by the government which would benefit the students community ultimately in long run," he said.Some parents hailed the move stating that now the college wouldn't dare to ask them for donations in cash. "Even if they demanded, we could tell them that it won't be possible for them to carry big cash. We could even lodge a complaint against them," they said. (With inputs from Sakina Dawood)

  MYSURU: Chief Minister Siddaramaiah on Sunday claimed that Prime Minster Narendra Modi's demonetization had no effect on those keeping black money, while it has negatively impacted traders, farmers and the poor.
  

  Siddaramaiah was in Nanjangud to lay the foundation stone for a water projects to fill 29 lakes in Nanjangud taluk. Speaking to the reporters at Hullahalli helipad, Siddaramaiah said, "No black money holders ever stood in the queues in front of banks and ATMs. Demonetization of notes is a criminal offence by the government. Banks have also breached their trust with customers," he said.
  

  On central fund for drought, the CM said monsoon has completely failed in the state, but the government is prepared to address drinking water and fodder issues in villages. "Water is being supplied to all the areas in tankers, and fodder banks have been opened in some places," he said. Meanwhile, He accused the Centre for not providing enough funds to address the drought situation.
  

  Siddaramaiah later laid the foundation stone for projects for filling water to lakes from Kapila River in Hura village. "In the past three years, the state government spent Rs 40 crore for irrigation projects in the region, and for two years, it has earmarked Rs 20 crore. A total of Rs 2,917 crore is being spent for development of irrigation canals in south zone," he said.
  

  Public works minister HC Mahadevappa said the government has taken up drinking water projects in Mysuru and Chamarajangar district worth Rs 300 crore. "Out of 176 taluks, groundwater has considerably depleted in 86 taluks and various lake development works have been taken up," he said.
  

  MP R Druvanarayana, sugar minister HC Mahadeva Prasad, MLAs and ZP members were present.

  VARANASI: Continuing its campaign against demonetization, the Congress will begin a nationwide movement in the new year. The Mumbai Congress committee president Sanjay Nirupam said that the party is going to begin a nationwide campaign against demonetization from January 6.
  

  Nirupam was here on Friday to take part in the 'Sawal Satygrah' over demonetization being organised by the local unit of Congress. Talking to reporters, he said that the Congress workers will gherao the district headquarters across the country on January 6, while woman wing will come to street with beating 'thali' (plate) on January 8. The party will continue the campaign on regular basis to express its protest.
  

  He said that demonetization was an immature and foolish decision of the Prime Minister taken in haste without any proper planning. It completely failed in eradicating black money, corruption and fake currency, he said adding that so far black money worth of Rs. 4200 crore was seized for which an hefty amount of Rs. 24,000 crore was spent on printing of new currency notes. The demonetization also failed to put a check on corruption, as 30% growth in corruption was noticed in Maharashtra after scraping the higher denomination notes.
  

  He alleged that BJP leaders are involved in hoarding black money. "Not a single Congress leader was caught with black money, while 37 BJP leaders with black money to the tune of Rs. 640 crore were caught in different parts of the country. It proves their involvement in amassing black money," he said adding that the account of BJP president Amit Shah should also be checked.
  

  He further said that most of the ATMs could not be calibrated and less than 40% ATMs have cash even today. Only 5-6 lakh crore currency note are circulation against the scrapped 14.5 lakh crore notes of higher denomination. He alleged that the PM's decision destroyed the strong economy of the country, which will take years to overcome the crisis. After the failure of demonetization the PM is talking about cashless economy that will benefit the card companies, he said and added that 90% transaction is done with cash in India, while it is 80% in USA and China.
  

  "We fear that the PM will come with some similar announcement in his address to the nation on Saturday," he said adding that the government should end of withdrawal limit of money from Saturday. Besides, measures should also be taken to compensate the loss of farmers and industries during this period. The government should also take cognizance of those who died due to cash crunch during this period, he added.
  

  To a query regarding Congress and SP alliance in UP 2017 polls, he said that any decision in this regard will be taken by the party leadership only. On family feud in SP he said that it is the internal matter of SP, but the chief minister Akhilesh Yadav should come out in 'fresh air'.

  NOIDA: Over 40% of rice crop from kharib season is harvested and piled up in the villages of Gautam Budh Nagar, waiting to be sold.
  

  The whole sellers of the region, largely located in the wholesale crop market of Dankaur, have refused to pick up the crop as they do not have enough cash available in new banknotes, post the demonetization of Rs500 and Rs1000 banknotes.
  

  "The farmers have been going to the market. A large number of farmers had sold their crop before the announcement, so they are not affected, but about 40% farmers, harvested their crops later and by the time their rice was ready for the market, the announcement came. The government has announced the wholesale buyers who procure crops from farmers to withdraw Rs50, 000 per week from the bank. That amount is not enough to procure the huge supplies that is yet to be picked up from the fields," Dushyant Nagar, convenor, Kisan Sangharsh Samiti (KSS) told TOI.
  

  The members of Kisan Sangharsh Samiti on Sunday went from village to village to check out the status of unsold crop. According to KSS members, the farmers expressed fear that if the crop yield is not collected now, the farmers may be pushed to a distress situation which compels them to sell at cheap rates.
  

  "Finally, the crops would either perish or have to be sold in distress at cheap rates. If the farmers are forced to sell their crops at cheap rates, the financial situation in the villages would go down severely. Already many farmers have been affected by the demonetization of Rs500 and Rs1000 notes," Kapil Nagar, a farmer from Greater Noida's Patwari village, said.
  

  "First rice is not getting sold at most villages, second wheat is not getting sown properly. So this will ultimately impact the supply chain. We are presently taking stock of how each village has been affected by the demonetization and trying to see how the farmers can be helped," Nagar added.

  , which is said to have resulted in a drop in the legal tender being released by banks.
  

  Between November 10 and 18, notes worth Rs 1.36 lakh crore were pumped out by banks, but the value dropped to Rs 1.14 lakh crore between November 18 and 27. It was around a week after the demonetisation kicked in that reports surfaced that the printing of Rs 2,000 notes had been stalled to generate more of the new Rs 500 notes. Unlike the Rs 2,000 notes, which were printed weeks in advance, the RBI had no stockpile of the new Rs 500 notes.
  

  The total amount of legal tender released since November 9 amounts to Rs 2,50,115 crore, which is around 18% of the value of the withdrawn notes. Of this, Rs 2,16,617 crore was withdrawn from banks and ATMs.
  

  There were expectations in the government that
  old notes+
  worth Rs 3 lakh crore would not return to the banking system. This, it was believed, would result in a fall in the RBI's liabilities and thus translate into windfall gains for the government. However, if the current pace of deposit accretion continues, the value of the old notes coming back would inch up, and the windfall gains may not be realised.

  AGRA: Accusing Prime Minister Narendra Modi of being anti-Hindu, senior members of Akhil Bharatiya Hindu Mahasabha have said that the Centre's demonetisation move would be the beginning of the end of his rule. The saffron organisation alleged that the policy had been introduced just before the start of the Hindu wedding season while BJP members were encouraging Islamic banks in the country.
  

  Questioning the government's currency move, Mahasabha's national general secretary Pooja Shakun Pandey said the purpose of the scheme is yet not known. "Poor people, those who earn Rs 200-300 every day or those who survive on paltry government pensions, are the ones who are suffering. The move doesn't seem to have made an impact on the rich," she said in Aligarh.
  

  "Besides, it was announced just before the Hindu wedding season. Thousands of families were forced to borrow money from their friends and relatives, some others had to postpone, curtail or even cancel the ceremonies. At the same time, leaders of the so called Hindutva party were busy promoting Islamic banking in the country," she said.
  

  Pandey was referring to Sholapur's BJP MLA and Maharashtra cooperation minister Subhash Deshmukh who launched the country's first sharia-compliant Islamic banking service in Sholapur in September. At the Lokmangal Cooperative Bank Ltd, controlled by Deshmukh, interest-free deposits will be accepted from both Muslims and non-Muslims and distributed largely to the needy from the minority community at zero rates of interest to ensure their financial inclusion.
  

  Alleging that Modi's "Hindutva" mask was now off for all to see, a Mahasabha member said, "Demonetisation would eventually lead to de-Modi-tisation of the country."
  

  Mahasabha's members also accused Modi of trying to garner support for "fake" surgical strikes. Its UP spokesperson, Ashok Kumar Pandey, said, "Cross-border terrorism has gone up. Our soldiers are dying in border skirmishes every day. The surgical strikes, if there were any, haven't done the country any good." Taking on "aggressive" Modi supporters, Pandey said, "They have created a fear psychosis in the country by branding all those opposed to PM's policies or ideas as 'anti-nationals'. That leaves common people who are hugely inconvenienced by the cash crunch with no other choice than hailing the move."
