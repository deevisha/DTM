
New Delhi: Cash-strapped INA market is slowly returning to normalcy as businesses have started to transact online. From tobacconists to fruit vendors, mobile wallets have become quite a hit with local retailers.
Ritu Batra, a local fruit vendor whose business halved in the days following the scrapping of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 banknotes, said she has recently started accepting money through Paytm and MSwipe. According to her, barely few shops in the South Delhi market had card swipe machines. She said her current account in a government bank doesn’t allow her the facility to accept payments through credit and debit cards. Many stores in the market have put up posters to deter customers with old currency notes of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 denominations. A poster in front of a meat shop said: “Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes not accepted. Please pay with Rs 100 notes.” However, many grocery and garment stores have pasted stickers near their cash counters saying they accept payment through mobile wallets.
Rajender Gupta, a grocery store owner, said  that with mobile wallets becoming popular with customers and businesses alike, sales are slowly picking up. But the ongoing liquidity crunch due to withdrawal of large currency notes, some of the businesses are still affected in a big way. A customer executive at Duggal Forex (P) Ltd said the currency exchange business has taken a big hit due to the demonetization move. “The business will get back on track only when banks start giving us cash,” the executive said.
Manoj Kumar, who has been running a flower shop in the INA market for last 30 years, said he is yet to start transacting online. The sales had plummeted following the withdrawal of high-value currency notes, but it is slowly picking up due to the ongoing marriage season, he said.   **************************************************



Mumbai: During an off record conversation with a senior Enforcement Directorate official here, it has come to light that the traditional modus operandi for laundering money by the medium of gold purchase/sell has seen a huge boost post demonetisation.
However, the ED is looking into the aspect that despite having almost nil demand post demonetisation why bullions were importing so much gold. The initial probe indicates a huge racket of money laundering in this trade.
As per the official, a total 66,000 kilograms of gold was imported in November all over the country, with Mumbai importing 1,250 kilograms and Delhi 25,000 kilograms, becoming the city with maximum gold being imported.
The ED suspects that diamond was also a mode of exchanging black money through shell companies.
According to ED sources, many diamond companies are being investigated for their transaction in the post demonetization period.
So far, no arrests have been made in this matter of gold and diamond transactions but ED is looking in it very minutely.
ED's job is made tougher by the organised manner in which the shell companies have been working.
Generally, ED comes to know about any suspicious transaction in 2 working days on an average but suspicious deposits are being rotated from one account to another in less time than that i.e. on a daily basis or on every alternate day, which makes it difficult for the ED to keep a track.
However, ED sources have claimed that they will soon unearth this racket of gold and diamond for money laundering.  **************************************************




Mumbai: Former chief economic adviser to the erstwhile Congress-led Manmohan Singh government has said that the BJP-led Narendra Modi government’s move to ban the high value currency notes is "hurting people who aren’t its intended targets". 
Basu who advised the government of India on economic affairs during 2009-12 writes in his New York Times opinion piece ‘In India, black money makes for a bad policy’ that demonetization was ostensibly implemented to combat corruption, terrorism financing and inflation.
“But it was poorly designed, with scant attention paid to the laws of the market, and it is likely to fail,” Basu writes. 
Basu is of the opinion that more pain would be in offing for common man as a colossal Rs 14 lakh crore worth currency notes in circulation were suddenly withdrawn from the banking system.
“India’s economic growth is bound to nose-dive,” he mentions in his NYT piece. According to him, rupee could also depreciate as people and investors likely to move to more robust currencies.

The Gross Domestic Product (GDP) report, which will come out on Wednesday will highlight the amount of loss which has taken place due to the currency demonetisation of November 8.
According to a Bloomberg survey of economists, expansion has probably accelerated to 7.5 per cent, while analysts are cutting down the growth forecast to 7.4 per cent from 7.7 per cent this year.
"Attention has shifted to the impact of the demonetization initiative on the real economy," Radhika Rao, an economist at DBS Bank Ltd. in Singapore, wrote in a report on Monday. Growth in October-December could dip below 6 percent, she said.
The biggest concern though is how soon the Indian economy will be able to rebound from Modi’s measure. A projected slowdown has certainly put the world’s fastest growing economy at risk.
Thomas Rookmaaker, director in Fitch Ratings's Asia-Pacific Sovereigns Group said that "Macroeconomic effects of the cash crunch include a temporary delay of consumption and investment, disrupted supply chains, farmers being unable to buy inputs, and some loss in productivity due to time lost to deal with cash issues."
Modi may need until May to replace the 23 billion bank notes he's sucked out, say some estimates. But Morgan Stanley's Chetan Ahya says that about 98 per cent of cash required for transactions will be in the system by mid-December. This means that consumption, which accounts for 60 per cent of GDP, will recover from the April-June quarter though private investment will take time to improve.
According to the median of 15 estimates in a Bloomberg survey conducted after Modi announced currency demonetisation, India's GDP will grow at 7.4 percent in the current fiscal year.
Central Bank Review
Following Wednesday's GDP data report presentation, which is scheduled to take place at 5:30 p.m. in New Delhi, attention will shift to a purchasing managers' index on Thursday, which will give first hand assessment of the impact on manufacturing. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) will be reviewing interest rates on December 7.
According to reports from Citigroup Inc, Reserve Bank of India Governor Urjit Patel will probably reduce the benchmark repurchase rate to 6 percent from 6.25 percent to arrest negative spillovers from the shock. Compilation of a private index by BSE Ltd. and the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy showed a sharp surge in urban unemployment this month.
According to Citigroup economists Samiran Chakraborty and Anurag Jha, "In an uncertain economic environment since the demonetization exercise, the December monetary policy has to focus on a prudent risk management approach rather than a simple growth-inflation trade-off."  **************************************************




New Delhi: More than 93 per cent of the five lakh people who participated in a survey on Narendra Modi App have supported demonetisation, the PMO said today a day after the Prime Minister sought public feedback on the issue. "I thank people for the historic participation in the survey.
It's satisfying to read the insightful views & comments," the Prime Minister tweeted along with the results of the survey conducted on Narendra Modi App. "Unprecedented response to App Survey, record number of citizens share their view," said the title of a write-up on narendramodi.in whose link was shared by the Prime Minister on his twitter account.
The survey result was read out by IT and Telecom Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad at Cabinet meeting this evening, prompting the Prime Minister to say that it "reflects the mood" of the people.
In just over 24 hours of the survey, more than 5 lakh people have participated and expressed their opinion, it said, adding "This is a staggering number by any stretch. No opinion survey conducted in India, on such policy or political issues, even comes close to sampling so many responses."
More than 93 per cent people support the move to demonetize the old 500 and 1000 rupee notes, it said. Of the over 5 lakh responses so far, only 2 per cent have rated the move as 'very poor' or 'one star', the survey result said.
More than 90 per cent of the respondents feel the government’s move to tackle black money is above four-star rating, the survey result says. 73 per cent of them give it five-star rating of 'brilliant'.
On the overall fight against corruption, more than 92 per cent of respondents either rate the government as 'very good' or 'good' while 57 per cent of them rate the fight as 'very good'.
"As high as 86 per cent people believe that some so- called anti-corruption activists are now actually batting in support of black money, corruption and even terrorist financing!", the write-up said.
The write-up said the demonetization survey was launched on the NM App yesterday at 10 AM and "the response has been phenomenal." Modi's move to gauge the views of the people directly came at a time when the opposition has escalated its attack on the issue of demonetisation.
Explaining the reason behind the Prime Minister's move on survey, the write-up said Modi's "belief in participative governance and direct engagement with people is unwavering" and "time and again, he has directly engaged with the people and sought their views on a wide range of issues.
"...It was then decided to speak directly to the people and take their views in an open, free, fair, and equitable poll. "Instead of intermediaries speaking on behalf of people,let the people speak for themselves. Let them say whether they support or oppose the demonetization move.
"Let them offer suggestions to alleviate the genuine inconveniences that some people may be facing. If someone has a well-argued case of opposing the move, let them say that too.
Overall, instead of just opinion, let data speak for the support for the move." Contending that the questions to which the Prime Minister had sought answers were "comprehensive and direct", the write-up said the queries also included opportunity to give feedback.
"The overall aim included means to make the implementation stronger and more effective," it said. The questions included "Do you have any suggestions/ideas or insights you would like to share with PM Narendra Modi."
Some of the other questions asked are: "Do you think black money exists in India? "Do you think the evil of corruption and black money need to be fought and eliminated? "What do you think of government's move of banning old Rs 500 and Rs 1000 notes? "Do you mind inconvenience faced in our fight to curb corruption, black money, terrorism and counterfeiting of currency?".

 The common man faced problems in exchanging the demonetised notes, it would amount to ‘pure and simple harassment’.

 New Delhi: Congress on Wednesday sought to pick holes in the Modi government’s decision to demonetise Rs 500 and Rs 1000 currency notes, saying if the idea was to address the issue of black money why has it decided to introduce Rs 2000 denomination notes, and terming the action as a "puzzle".The main opposition party said if the common man faced problems in exchanging the demonetised notes, it would amount to "pure and simple harassment".Former Finance Minister P Chidambaram told reporters that a similar move was also contemplated by the previous UPA government but the idea was dropped as "the economic gains were not too great"."Introduction of Rs 2000 note is a puzzle. How will this help in preventing generation of black money   If new income or wealth is unaccounted, will it not be hidden in Rs 2000 notes. How the purpose of demonestization of high denomination notes is served if a new and higher denomination note is introduced  Government must explain this apparent puzzle," he said.Chidambaram, a former Finance Minister, said Congress supported any move to check black money, but warned that the demonetisation exercise may cause initial contraction and disruption of economic activity. The real test, he said, would be how quickly the old notes are replaced.Chidambaram said while he supports the government's action taken to stamp out black money, "but the method adopted raises many questions"."We support the objective of government to stamp out black money. But the method they have adopted raises questions...The move has come as a bolt from the blue for the common man," he said."The move may cause initial contraction and some disruption of economic activity. The test will be how quickly the old notes are replaced," Chidambaram said.The former Finance Minister asked the government to handle the exchange of notes quickly, efficiently and without harassment to common people.Chidambaram spoke soon after Rahul Gandhi targeted PrimeMinister Narendra Modi over the move, wondering as to how bringing in the new Rs 2000 note is going to make black money hoarding a lot harder.In remarks laced with sarcasam, the Congress Vice President said "well done Mr Modi"."Real culprits" who have stashed black money are "sitting tight" while lives of farmers, small shopkeepers and housewives "have been thrown in utter chaos," he said in a series of tweets.Chidambaram said that introduction of the new series of notes is estimated to cost Rs 15,000 to Rs 20,000 crore and "the economic gains of demonetization should be at least equal to that amount"."If RBI form is made mandatory for housewives, small traders, it will be pure harassment and Congress party will condemn it," he said in reply to a question.Asked if it will help curb the use of black money used for funding terror activities, he said it is "complete exaggeration" to say that the bulk of black money is used for terrorist activities or to say that bulk of it is counterfeit money.  **************************************************



Greater Noida: Upset over the lack of money at banks even after 22 days of demonetization, villagers at Bilaspur on Wednesday blocked the Noida-Sikandrabad road, affecting traffic for more than an hour.
The banks at Mandi Shyam Nagar in Dankaur displayed a 'no cash' notice and when the villagers reached there they were left agitated, according to reports.
Locals said the villagers then closed the banks' gates from outside and held protest even as some of them blocked traffic on the Noida-Sikandrabad road.
For one and half hour traffic was affected. Senior police officers reached site and pacified the villagers after which the blockade was lifted.
"For the last three days I have been visiting the bank to withdraw Rs 2,000 but am unable to get the money. Banks claim they are not getting cash. The ATMs too are without cash," said one of the villagers, Dharam Bhati.
Another villager, Raje, alleged, "Bank officials give money to their known persons out of turn while the common man after standing in queue for hours was told there was no cash and was sent back."
At Udyog Bandhu meeting held today at DM camp office in Noida, some industrialists raised the problems emerging due to demonetization before the district magistrate N P Singh.
"Small industries' production was affected. Though the government has allowed withdrawal of Rs 50,000 from current accounts but bank officials are refusing such withdrawals, saying there was no cash at banks," they claimed.  **************************************************



New Delhi: Taking a swipe at Prime Minister Narendra Modi for ridiculing Rahul Gandhi's remarks, senior Congress leader P Chidambaram said though he too could ridicule him, he will not do that and said Modi should rather answer the questions posed.
"He (Rahul) says mock me but answer the questions of the people, the duty to respond to the question... lies with the Prime Minister... however he is ridiculing and acting (mocking Rahul)," Chidambaram said.
Stating that he too knows how to mock and poke fun, the former finance minister said, "I can also talk like Prime Minister... and ridicule..., however, I will not do that because he is India's Prime Minister."
Chidambaram said though Modi belonged to "another party" and "propagated several policies that we cannot accept, I respect him as he is India's Prime Minister. I will not ridicule him or poke fun at him, I only ask questions, he should answer the questions."
"Why are you (the Centre and Modi) punishing people like this (by demonetising) and what sin have they committed? Why are you harassing people and the farmers... what is the reason...I would like to ask," he said.
He said Rahul Gandhi is addressing people in several states, including Gujarat, on demonetisation and related issues.
"The Prime Minister addresses meetings, Rahul Gandhi is also doing it and the media is giving equal importance to his speeches like they do for the PM and I welcome it. However that is not enough," he said and described the claims of BJP government regarding demonetization as "falsehood." Corruption is happening black money is being hoarded by using Rs 2,000 notes, he claimed and said party workers should apprise people on such "false claims."
"I bow my head before the people for their patience," Chidambaram said, adding people are perhaps waiting for the Prime Minister's December 30 deadline for things to get normal.
"No government or Prime Minister has the authority to inflict so much pain and harassment on the people. They did not vote for them (BJP) for this," he said.
Chidambaram said the Prime Minister should have accepted that he had taken a wrong decision. "He (Modi) is a big (magnanimous) man... had he said that I made a mistake, had Modi sought forgiveness, he would have been a big man," the senior Congress leader said. He said Indira Gandhi had generously admitted that promulgation of Emergency in 1975 was a mistake as it had led to suffering of people (not in Tamil Nadu) and promised to never do it again till such time she was Prime Minister.
"That is why she continues to live in the hearts of people as a towering leader though she passed away 32 years ago," he said.
"There is nothing wrong in accepting one's mistake…there is nothing wrong in saying that I have done a mistake." Chidambaram said if Modi had admitted he had taken a "wrong decision based on wrong advice" and he was not told of the quantum of currency that will be scrapped, it would have been generous.
If Modi had said he was not apprised about the note printing capacity and how many months it would take to print such notes and on the duration of ATM recalibration, he would have been magnanimous, he said.
Modi should have admitted that he had not taken into consideration the fact that people would be hit and daily wage earners would be affected, Chidambaram said.  **************************************************



Patna: Seeking immediate withdrawal of demonetisation drive, West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee staged a protest in Patna on Wednesday. While dubbing the drive as “super Emergency”, Ms Banerjee vowed to agitate against it till a rollback of the decision is announced by the Centre.
“The government has taken away the freedom from the people that they have been enjoying for the past 69 years. The government has snatched ‘Roti, Kapda aur Makan’ from the people... A people’s movement was started during the Emergency days... Today, the situation is even worse than Emergency, it can be termed as super Emergency,” the Trinamul Congress supremo said.
“People are facing difficulties and inconveniences. They (NDA government) have sold the country. It is the duty of political parties to raise their voice for the people and we will continue with our agitation till the government takes a decision to roll back the demonetisation move,” she said.
Ms Banerjee has been at the forefront of the protest against the Narendra Modi government’s decision to scrap Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 currency notes. Sharing dais with senior RJD leader Raghuvansh Prasad Singh, she said she stands with the common man.
“I had two options — to either go with the Prime Minister on the issue or to stand with common people. I chose common people because I feel the Prime Minister has snatched away the basic means of livelihood from them by this demonetisation drive” Ms Banerjee said in Patna.
At one point during the rally, she also used terms like “traitors” for leaders who didn’t support the movement. She said,“People will not forgive such leaders who betrayed them by supporting the move”.
Observers believe that the term was used for Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar who supported Mr Modi on the demonetisation move. Ms Banerjee had earlier met RJD chief Lalu Yadav in Patna on Tuesday.
Mounting an attack on Nitish Kumar for supporting the drive, RJD leader Raghuvansh Prasad Singh said, “Nitish Kumar’s support to currency ban is a blow to the grand alliance in Bihar but our stand is clear on the issue”.
Miss Banerjee who had met RJD Chief Lalu Yadav after she arrived in Patna on Tuesday had thanked him for his support but when asked about Nitish Kumar’s stand on the issue she said,  “His party like any other political party has its own stand on the issue but I thank Lalu Yadav for his support”.  
Earlier Mr. Yadav and his son, Deputy Chief Minister of Bihar Tejaswi Yadav had clarified that “RJD was in favour of the move but against its poor implementation”.  **************************************************



Baran (Rajasthan): Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi has one again accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi of sacrificing poor people in his so called war against corruption and black money. Addressing a public rally in Rajasthan’s Baran on Monday, he said that instead of targeting the rich, who hides their black money in real estate, gold and off shore accounts, the PM has attacked the majority that is honest, comprising poor and middle class who keep their money in cash.
“Why Modiji has targeted 99 per cent of the population, which keeps money in cash. I want to tell him that the cash these people keep is not black but white. It is their hard earned money, which he has taken to give to his rich friends,” he alleged.
“Demonetisation has been extremely harsh on ordinary people like farmers, labourers, shopkeepers, housewives and the youth. Not only they were made cashless but also rendered them unemployed as the demonetisation, he said, resulted in economic lockdownt as industries were forced to closed down because farmers, labourers, small traders and industries deal in cash,” he added.
While sticking to the old theme of “Garibon se kheencho, ameeron ko seencho (Take from the poor to pay the rich), however, Mr Gandhi brought a new dimension to his allegations, saying that the government won’t lift restriction on bank withdrawals because it wants your money to stay in banks as long as possible to help them restructure debts of big companies owned by the PM’s friends who accompanies him on his foreign tours.
“I can tell you that you will not be able to withdraw your own money as much as you wished because the government won’t remove restrictions on it because than you will withdraw all your money leaving nothing for the banks to lend the PM’s friends rich friends,” he said.
According to the Congress vice-president, the PM described demonetisation as national yajna that requires sacrifice, however, he alleged that only the poor was made to sacrifice while the rich are sitting comfortably as they adjusted their black money before the demonetisation was launched since they were privy to this decision. To lend strength to his allegation, he cited unusual surge in bank deposits to the tune of `6 lakh crore a month before the demonetisation was announced suggesting that it was done by the PM’s “super rich” friends. Apart from that he also mentioned land purchased and money in crores deposited by some state units of the BJP.
The Congress, he said, would support any decision of the NDA government against corruption and black money. but it opposed demonetization because it has ulterior motives. Referring to Home Minister Rajnath Singh’s defence of demonetization that it was a good policy but planning was poor. “I want to tell Rajnath Singh ji that he should not leave under any illusion about the PM. I have been told by Shankar Singh Vaghela who was once close to him that Modi ji is a superb planner,” he said suggesting that real motive behind demonetization were different than what is being propagated.
“The demonetization plan was hatched to help 50 top business families. They can’t borrow more because they already owe Rs 8 lakh crore to the public sector banks. And, because of this the banks do not have money to lend them. So, he devised this plan to keep your money in banks for six-seven months to help the banks restructure debts of these rich people who finance his publicity campaign,” he alleged. He also took a jibe at the PM by tweaking line of a famous Bollywood song saying, “Ram Ram japna, garib ka mall apna.”
If he (PM) was serious about removing black money, he would have disclosed names of 648 persons given to his government by swiss government who have black money stashed in swiss bank accounts.
Reiterating his allegation of personal corruption against the PM, the Congress vice president waived documents claiming that these were official documents of the IT department that proved that the PM received money from Sahara and Birla group paid money.  **************************************************



Patna: RJD chief Lalu Yadav who had earlier locked horns with the Prime Minister over the demonetisation issue, on Wednesday launched a protest against the Centre’s move in Patna and all district headquarters of the state. The protest, however, was skipped by the JD (U) and Congress party.
Mr Yadav in an attempt to downplay the differences said that a massive rally will be his next move against Modi government and said,  “I have not been isolated as Congress is also against demonetisation.”
Dubbing the demonetisation policy as “anti-farmer and anti-poor”, Mr Yadav said that a large number of people who had migrated to other cities as daily wage earners have returned to their villages.  
The absence of JD (U) and Congress from the protest also indicated a division within the grand secular alliance in Bihar over the issue of demonetisation.
“The economy has collapsed and people are being harassed unnecessarily due to improper implementation of demonetisation policy,” RJD chief Lalu Yadav said, while addressing his party workers during the protest in Patna.
He said, “People have been cheated as Mr Modi failed in his promises to bring back black money from Swiss bank.”
He also thanked West Bengal Chief Minister Mamta Banerjee for opposing demonetization.
RJD is the single largest party in Bihar and a key constituent in the grand secular alliance government along with JD (U) and Congress. Congress had pulled out at the last minute citing personal reasons while JD (U) said that “the party will review its stand after the deadline is over”.
Expressing disappointment and anger over leaving RJD isolated in its fight against demonetization senior RJD leader and legislator Bhai Birendra said, “those who have neglected the issues of common man will face serious consequences in future”. Lalu had earlier blamed “ego of some leaders as a big hurdle”.  **************************************************



New Delhi: S&P Global Ratings today said demonetisation and a likely GST rollout from September 2017 are likely to cast a "higher disruptive impact" on informal, rural, and cash-based segments of the economy. It further said corporates and banks are likely to face short-term downside risk as the demonetisation-induced cash crunch will curtail GDP growth.
"Indian government reforms will have long-term structural benefits, but carry short-term execution and adjustment risks," S&P Global Ratings Credit Analyst Abhishek Dangra said in an article titled India's Demonetization And the GST: Short-term Pain For Long-term Gain, published today.
The rating agency recently revised downwards its estimated economic growth rate for 2016-17 by one full percentage point to 6.9 per cent to reflect the disruption caused by the surprise move of demonetisation.
It said the government's decision to cancel the legal tender status of high-value rupee notes has caused a significant physical cash crunch. "Both demonetisation and a goods and services tax (GST, expected to be implemented by September 2017) are likely to have a higher disruptive impact on the informal, rural, and
cash-based segments of the economy," S&P said.
It said these reforms could benefit India in the long run after short-term pain. The credit and risk analysis firm believes that demonetisation and GST could result in a wider tax base and greater participation in the formal economy. This should benefit India's business climate and financial system in the long run.
"We believe such measures can promote greater economic flexibility, strengthen the business climate, funnel more wealth into the formal banking system, and help redress public finances over time," said Kyran Curry, also a credit analyst of S&P Global Ratings.
"We expect lower private consumption in fiscal 2017, but expect demand to revive and growth to rebound in fiscal 2018. India should shortly revert back to an 8 per cent annual growth trajectory," says Dharmakirti Joshi, Chief Economist of Crisil, a subsidiary of S&P Global. "In our base case, we expect a short-lived disruption with demand revival in the next one to two quarters, limiting the impact on Indian banks and corporates.
In the short term, however, the rural and informal sectors are experiencing large-scale adjustments. Business sectors that often transact in cash, including jewellery and real estate, will also face some degree of upheaval, S&P said.
"The banking sector will face marginally negative pressure in the short run as loan growth will remain soft, and asset quality and earnings will be pressurised at the margin.
Digital banking and higher banking base could benefit the banks in the long run," said another credit analyst of S&P Global Ratings, Geeta Chugh. In a less-likely downside scenario, the shock of demonetisation will not be absorbed within the next few months and the economic disruption will spill over into fiscal 2018,
and potentially coincide with the introduction of GST, the US-based agency said.
It added that in a less probable situation, economic growth will stay lower for longer, raising stress levels on corporates, banks, and other financial institutions; although the sovereign rating is likely to remain resilient.  **************************************************



Kolkata: While chief minister Mamata Banerjee has been on a war path against the Centre over demonetisation, the cancellation of legal tender of Rs 1000 and Rs 500 notes appears to have benefitted her government’s power department in terms of revenue generation.
State power minister Sovandeb Chattopadhyay on Tuesday said that the collection by the West Bengal State Electricity Distribution Company Ltd (WBSEDCL), the state-run power distribution company, for the month of November this year surpassed the amount of the corresponding month last year by over Rs 230 crore.
A data on WBSEDCL Collection Comparative Figure, provided by Mr Chatterjee showed that the earning of the month of November, 2015, which stands at Rs 1388.9 crore, rose by 16.82 per cent to Rs 1622.48 crore in the November this year. The earning thus grew by Rs 233.58 crore.
The state power minister however attributed the growth to the demonetization. “In wake of demonetization many consumers who had outstanding electricity bills cleared their due amounts at one go in November through lumpsum payments which mostly included old notes. Besides new consumers also paid for their connections in old notes,” he explained.
Mr Chattopadhyay elaborated that the change in power tariff of the WBSEDCL also helped in the revenue growth. According to the data, the earning of November this year was the highest among the months since August when the figure stood at Rs 1596.5 crore which was 10.53 per cent higher than the earning of August, 2015: Rs 1444.37 crore.
In September the collection witnessed a minor decrease to Rs 1583.88 crore which was however 11.58 per cent higher than Rs 1419.53 crore of the last year’s corresponding month. In October the collection further dipped to Rs 1491.66 crore but was still higher than Rs 1388.9 crore recorded in October, 2015 by 5.94 per cent.  **************************************************



Agartala/Kolkata/Trivandrum: Normal life was hit in Left-ruled Tripura on Monday in response to a dawn-to-dusk bandh to protest against demonetisation and press for the use of the old high-value notes till the situation became normal.
The bandh evoked a good response in the state with schools, colleges and shops remaining closed and vehicles staying off the roads. However, banks were open as they were out of the purview of the bandh.
There was no untoward incident in any part of the state till noon, police said.
Opposition Congress, which is opposing the bandh, was observing 'Akrosh Diwas' in the state by organising rallies and processions.
"We are against demonetisation because it is inconveniencing people but we are against the bandh because it also causes inconveniences," Tripura Pradesh Congress
Committee (TPCC) President and MLA Birajit Sinha said.
Tripura unit of Trinamul Congress (TMC) also opposed the bandh on the same grounds.
"We are against demonetisation but do not support the bandh because it spoils work culture and also causes monetary loss of common people," TMC spokesperson Asish Saha told reporters.
The Tripura unit of BJP was also opposed to the bandh. President of Tripura unit of BJP Biplab Deb said, "Political parties supporting black money have called the bandh".
But the strike failed to evoke much response in West Bengal.
Government and private buses, trams and other private vehicles were seen plying on the road while most of the shops and markets were open.
Train services of Eastern Railway in Sealdah and Howrah sections, besides Metro Rail services were also normal, Railway sources said.
"So far there has been no incident. The situation is peaceful and normal", ADG (Law and Order) Anuj Sharma told PTI.
The strike call by the Left Front has been opposed by the ruling TMC in West Bengal.
Transport Minister and senior Trinamool Congress leader Suvendu Adhikari said his department is plying 3000 more buses to maintain normalcy.
"It seems the people have rejected the strike call. The people of Bengal very well know that strike does not serve any purpose. If you want to oppose anti-people decision you have to hit the streets," TMC secretary general Partha Chatterjee told PTI.
The Left Front claimed that the strike is going on peacefully and accused ruling TMC of trying to unleash violence at certain places.
"The people of the state have willingly participated in the strike to oppose demonetization. In most of the places it is peaceful but in certain areas TMC is using its muscle power to break the strike," CPI(M)LP leader Sujan Chakraborty said.
LF leaders including the Front chairman Biman Bose and CPI-M state secretary Surjya Kanta Mishra took to the streets and participated in a procession in the metropolis.
"We are not demanding a roll back of demontisation. What we want is that common people should not face any hardship," Bose said.
Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, opposing the strike had said, "We oppose bandhs. We will take out a protest march (against demonetisation) on Monday."
The 12-hour strike called by the CPI(M)-led LDF government in Kerala, began this morning in the state.
In the early hours of the strike which started at 6 AM, autorickshaws were seen plying in some places, providing some relief to people.
Police vehicles were used to transport railway passengers and patients coming from far off places to the Regional Cancer Centre here.
Kerala State Road Transport Corporation (KSRTC) and private buses are keeping off roads in most places.
Some Sabarimala pilgrims who arrived at Kottayam by train complained that they were unable to leave for the Ayyappa temple as buses were not plying.
"We have been waiting for hours. Though some private taxis are available, we cannot afford them as the fares are exorbitant," a man from Andhra Pradesh said.
The tourism sector and vehicles of Sabarimala pilgrims have been exempted from the strike.
Keeping in mind the peak tourist season, the government had decided to exempt tourists from the strike. It has issued instructions to all departments concerned, including police to take all possible steps to ensure that the tourism sector was not hit by the strike.
Tourism Minister Kadakampally Surendran had also requested for exemption of tourists and tourist vehicles from the strike.
German Cruise liner AIDAbella which had arrived in Kochi made a turnaround call at the Kochi port yesterday.
At least 1000 tourists would be arriving at the airport today to embark the vessel, while some would be leaving it to explore various places.
Tour operators were assured by Tourism Principal Secretary V Venu that the hartal would not affect the visitors.
The opposition Congress-led UDF would be taking out a march to the Raj Bhavan here at 11 AM on the crisis being faced by the cooperative sector.
Banks, newspapers, milk supply, hospitals and marriage functions would be exempted from the shutdown, LDF convener Vaikom Viswam had said in a statement.
The LDF had announced the strike as part of the nationwide protest against the Centre's move of scrapping Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes.
Congress and the Left parties on Monday organised protests in Hyderabad and other places in Telangana as part of the 'Aakrosh Diwas' called by them to highlight the hardships faced by people following the Centre's demonetisation move.
Congress leaders and workers, led by state party chief N Uttamkumar Reddy, held a protested Saifabad here.
"This protest is to highlight the great inconvenience people are facing even 20 days after the decision (of demonetising Rs 500 and Rs 1000 notes) was announced," Reddy told reporters.
Left activists and leaders also took out protests at several places in Telangana over the issue.
However, public transport buses plied almost normally and shops and other commercial establishments remained open. Educational institutions also functioned normally.
The protests evoked mixed reaction in Bihar where workers of RJD, Congress and Left parties disrupted train services at many places but offices and schools registered normal attendance.
The protest had its echo in both Houses of the Bihar legislature where legislators of Congress, RJD and CPI-ML raised slogans against scrapping of Rs 1,000 and Rs 500 notes.
BJP legislators countered them by raising slogans against them and in favour of demonetisation. JD(U), a member of the ruling alliance, kept away from the stir in view of Chief Minister Nitish Kumar's consistent support to demonetisation of high value notes to fight black money in the economy.
Congress, RJD and CPI-ML took out a protest march on the streets of Patna and stalled traffic movement at some places.
Road traffic was, however, normal and attendance in offices, banks and schools and colleges remained by and large unaffected.
Train services were hit at Darbangha, Madhubani, Masauri in rural Patna, Ara, Jehanabad and other places.
Chief Public Relations Officer (CPRO) of East Central Railway Arvind Kumar Rajak said running of more than a dozen trains was disrupted in different parts of Bihar due to the stir.
In Darbhanga, Ara, Masaurhi and Madhubani, CPI workers squatted on railway tracks.
Outside Bihar Legislative Assembly and Legislative Council, bandh supporters from RJD, Congress and CPI-ML, holding placards in their hands, shouted slogans at the entrance gate.
BJP MLAs led by leader of opposition Prem Kumar countered them by raising slogans in favour of demonetisation.
Opposition parties organized widespread protests across Andhra Pradesh but no bandh as such was observed in the state on Monday even as leaders of CPI and YSRC were detained at some places following demonstrations.
Congress's state unit president N Raghuveera Reddy led his party workers in a protest rally from Andhra Ratna Bhavan to Lenin Centre.
"We are not against the scrapping of Rs 500 and Rs 1000 notes but why did the government introduce Rs 2000 note," Raghuveera said.
He said the common man was put to untold misery because of the "abrupt" decision of the Centre to ban the high denomination notes.
CPI state secretary K Ramakrishna and others were taken into custody at the Lenin Centre where they staged a protest on the demonetisation issue.
In Tirupati, YSR Congress leader Bhumana Karunakar Reddy and others were taken into custody. In Guntur city too YSRC leaders, led by West MLA Mustafa, were detained by police following a protest rally.
YSRC leaders and workers were also taken into custody in many other districts of the state where protests were held. Left-affiliated trade unions organised dharnas in front of many bus depots of AP State Road Transport Corporation in the state.
However, RTC services were not disrupted.  **************************************************



The Opposition parties may themselves have come to the conclusion that their nationwide protest call on Monday served little purpose other than reinforce empty ritualism, that has emerged as the bane of our public life. The Left parties, mainly the CPI(M), were guilty of this more than the others by seeking a bandh or all-India shutdown.
Quite apart from the fact that this would have thrown ordinary people into a wore quandary than the one in which they already find themselves as they have to spend hours in bank queues due to demonetisation, the Leftists forgot they have little public support in the country at this time.
Who cares if they enforced a near-bandh in Kerala, where they run a government? That merely demonstrates that a bandh works only when you have power — government authority or people’s power. In Parliament, the protest against demonetisation, that is neither an anti-black money measure nor a welfare measure for the poor, has gone on for over a week. All the Opposition parties have wisely declared that while they support the eradication of black money and corrupt practices as laudable goals, demonetisation is not intended to meet those objectives, contrary to what the government claims.
The whole idea of first protesting in Parliament and then outside is misplaced. Remember, people have resilience and can take some hardship in their stride. Let the Opposition change tack and press for a debate on taking black money out of party funding and running election campaigns. That will be refreshing, and helpful too.  **************************************************




New Delhi: Mocking the Congress-led meet of eight parties against demonetisation, BJP on Tuesday said it was Rahul Gandhi's "flop show" and that the bubble of opposition unity had burst before it could even take off.
Noting that only eight of the 16 parties which had joined hands in Parliament against the Modi government over note ban were present on Saturday, Union minister Ravi Shankar Prasad took potshots at Rahul, saying it was increasingly becoming clear that he lacked "maturity and gravitas" and that he would soon be left alone to "hurl abuses without substance".
"We all saw Rahul Gandhi's flop show today. Those who claimed about opposition unity could merely bring together eight of the 16 parties. Soon they will be reduced to four.
Earlier on Tuesday, Rahul Gandhi and TMC chief Mamata Banerjee along with some regional parties sought to put up a united face raising the pitch against demonetisation by demanding the resignation of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
After the eight-party meeting, the leaders also sought a probe into the issue of "personal corruption" of Modi with Gandhi insisting that a "free and fair" inquiry was needed to maintain the credibility of the Prime Minister's post.
Both Gandhi and Banerjee spoke of a "common minimum agenda" being evolved to take the opposition unity forward even as he downplayed the absence of several other parties, including the Left, from the meet which preceded the press conference.
The BJP mocked their meet and Prasad told a press conference that the opposition's exercise was "laughable" as, he said, those who were behind scams like 2G spectrum, Saradha chit fund and coal block allocations had come together to attack Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
 “Rahul Gandhi will be left on his own...to hurl abuses without substance. The bubble of opposition unity has burst before it could take off," he said.
The senior BJP leader kept Congress and Rahul Gandhi in his line of fire and skipped any mention of TMC chief and West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, who has been a staunch critic of the government's demonetisation move and again attacked Modi in today's exercise.
Noting that earlier parties would work together to put up a joint front against Congress, he said the opposition's press conference today was a victory for BJP and loss for Congress as it showed that as the saffron party has emerged as the centre of polity now.
Rahul and his party have been the biggest patron of corruption, Prasad alleged, saying that he kept quiet during the UPA government regime when several scams happened.

New Delhi: Even before the much-hyped protest against the Modi government’s demonetisation move could take off, cracks have surfaced within the Opposition with the Left going all out to prevent Trinamul supremo Mamata Banerjee from emerging as a key stretegist and the face unifying anti-BJP forces.
While the Opposition is gearing up for the protest march across the nation on November 28, the Left parties have called for a 12-hour Bengal bandh on the same day — a move that is being vehemently opposed by Ms Banerjee.
Cracks have also surfaced within the Grand Alliance. Bihar chief minister and JD(U) leader Nitish Kumar described demonetisation as a “brave move”.
However, Rashtriya Janata Dal and Congress, which are part of the Grand Alliance in Bihar, have been strongly opposing the move  right from the onset.
Congress, at the national level, is virtually leading the charge against demonetisation.
The Samajwadi Party has also been a striking discordant note with regard to their position on demonetisation. On one hand Rajya Sabha MP Naresh Agarwal launched a scathing attack against the move on the floor of the House, on the other hand party general secretary Amar Singh not only called it a “bold move” but also claimed that “he as a countryman was proud to have such Prime Minister who was so dedicated and adamant to root out corruption.” Further, only on Friday UP chief minister and SP leader Akhilesh Yadav cautioned Prime Minister Narendra Modi, saying that he would have to “pay for troubling the poor of the country”. Mr Singh’s sudden praise for the PM’s move is being viewed as a move to mend fences with the BJP since he is presently being hounded by a majority of  the top leaders in the party including Akhilesh Yadav. When asked whether he was considering joining another party, Mr Singh told the media that he was “very disturbed”. “I will take a final decision after talking to Mr Mulayam Singh,” he said.
The Biju Janata Dal has adopted an “ekla chalo” (go alone) approach and did not join the Opposition parties’ march to meet President Pranab Mukherjee on November 14. Congress leaders in Bhubaneswar have alleged that  BJD was trying to strike a deal with the BJP. Odisha state Congress president Prasad Harichandan on Saturday went to the extent of saying, “BJP president Amit Shah’s soft stance on the state chief minister Naveen Patnaik comes after the recent meeting between Mr Patanaik and Mr Modi that followed his unconditional support to the Centre’s demonetisation move. BJP and BJD are brothers in arms.”
Reacting to the 12-hour bandh called by the Left, a furious Ms Banerjee tweeted: In Delhi at the meeting of Opposition parties, a bandh was never discussed or agreed to. We do not support any bandh called. People are suffering so I appeal to all to help citizens and stand by them at this hour of crisis.”  **************************************************



Baran: Questioning Prime Minister Narendra Modi over his assurance to people that problems due to demonetisation will end after December 30, Rahul Gandhi on Monday said the "economic lockdown" will continue to hurt the poor, farmers and workers the most.
"Modiji has said that the problems will end after December 30. But I can say with confidence that it will not be so. These hardships will continue for six-seven months and beyond," the Congress Vice President said addressing a rally here.
He was referring to the Prime Minister's repeated assurance to the people that the problems due to note ban will begin to ease after the 50-day period.
Persisting with his attack on the demonetization issue, Gandhi alleged that the Modi Government at the centre and Vasundhara Raje government in Rajasthan had not taken a single step for the poor.
"The note ban decision is not against corruption but is an economic lockdown. It is not against blackmoney but against the poor, farmers, labourers and women," he alleged.
"99 per cent of the people do not have black money and they were targeted by the demonetisation drive while on the other hand, there are 50 families who have lakhs and crores of rupees and that is black money," he said.
Stating that the Congress party wants to eradicate corruption and its leaders would support the NDA government against the menace, Gandhi alleged that the decision of demonetisation was "totally against the people of the country".
He said that only six per cent black money is stored in cash while the remaining is in the form or real estate and gold and is also stashed in Swiss bank accounts.
"In the last two-and-a-half years, Modi only worked to create a divide in the country and functioned only for the rich," he alleged.
Rahul alleged that the Modi government tried to "murder" the Land Acquisition Act, which benefits the farmers, and also attempted to stall other pro-poor steps like MNREGA started by the Congress.
He alleged that the BJP governments have failed to fulfill three demands of the farmers, namely debt waiver, lower power tariff and proper price for their produce.
He also alleged that the tribals were being exploited in BJP-ruled states of Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand. "The entire government is functioning of the rich. What Narendra Modi ji is doing at the Centre, the same is being done by the chief minister of Rajasthan.
"In Rajasthan, privatisation is going on. Power tariff was raised by 18 per cent. Have Modiji and the BJP government here taken any step for the poor. They have done nothing for the poor," he said.  **************************************************



New Delhi: Opposition parties protested in various parts of the country against demonetisation on Monday.
DMK workers along with MK Stalin were taken into preventive custody by police in Chennai. In Jammu, Congress workers held a ‘Jan Aakrosh’ rally and were detained by the police.
Rahul Gandhi along with other Congress leaders held a small protest at Gandhi statue outside Parliament.
Left parties, including CPM and CPI, staged a protest in West Bengal capital Kolkata. However, the Left’s call for a bandh saw little public backing in the city as vehicles continued to ply and offices remained open.
Jammu and Kashmir CM Mehbooba Mufti however came out in strong support of the Modi government. She said that while demonetisation may cause hardship to the common man for a while, in the long run it would prove to be a historic decision for the country.
Meanwhile, the Rajya Sabha saw as many as three adjournments as the Opposition continued to protest over demonetisation, and demanded the presence of PM Narendra Modi in the House.
The demonetisation exercise by the Modi government has brought a rarely seen unity among Opposition parties, but they stand divided over the way they would protest against the measure.
While the Left parties, including the CPI(M) and CPI have called a 12-hour bandh to protest against demonetisation of old high-value currency notes in West Bengal, Mamata Banerjee's TMC did not join it on Monday.
The Congress too has decided not to go for a bandh.
Leader of Opposition in the Rajya Sabha, Ghulam Nabi Azad, on Monday denied that any all-India bandh call had been given by the opposition parties against demonetisation.
“In meeting of 18 opposition parties we decided to hold a ‘Jan Aakrosh’ rally, not a Bharat Bandh, said Azad.
Criticising the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), he claimed that the saffron party has the maximum amount of black money.
"The maximum amount of black money is with the BJP. Before criticizing other parties, they should introspect first. As far as the Bharat Bandh is concerned, nobody has spoken about a Bharat Bandh. We have not taken any call on or for a Bharat Bandh," said Azad.
Senior party leader Jairam Ramesh said no 'Bharat Bandh' has been called by the party which will hold nation-wide protests as part of 'Jan Aakrosh Diwas'.
The JD(U) has decided not to participate in the protests by opposition parties on Monday or West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee's proposed dharna in Patna on November 30 after its leader and Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar welcomed the demonetisation decision.
"We have supported he Centre's demonetisation move. How can we oppose or be the part of activity like bandh which is meant to protest the issue which our party has strongly supported," Bihar unit JD(U) President Bashishtha Narayan Singh said.
"JD(U) will not be part of any agitation against demonetisation including the dharna by Mamata Banerjee on November 30 in Patna," party Secretary General K C Tyagi said.
"We have taken an ideological position in favour of demonetisation so how can we be part of any agitation seeking its roll back," Tyagi said.
Odisha's ruling BJD also did not join the protests with its leader and Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik having hailed the demonetisation decision.
The opposition parties have been divided over the ways to protest against demonetisation ever since Mamata Banerjee decided to march to the President against it. While she was joined by AAP, National Conference and Shiv Sena, an NDA ally,
Other opposition parties stayed away. Shiv Sena has backed demonetisation but is unhappy over the way it was causing problems to people.
Mamata's TMC and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal's AAP are the only parties which have demanded a roll back of the exercise, while other parties have voiced displeasure over the way it was being implemented which was causing hardship to common people.  **************************************************

New Delhi: Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar has written to West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee expressing "deep pain" over her allegations against the army for its recent exercise at toll gates in the state and said they can "adversely" impact the morale of the armed forces.
In a strongly worded letter, Parrikar said that while political parties and politicians may have the luxury of making "wild and unsubstantiated allegations against each other", one needs to be extremely careful while referring to the armed forces.
"Your allegations in this regard run the risk of adversely impacting the morale of the country's armed forces and the same were not expected from a person of your standing and experience in public life," the Minister said.
Banerjee, who has been opposing the Centre's demonetization move, had accused it of deploying the army at toll plazas in West Bengal without informing the state government and described it as "unprecedented" and "a very serious situation worse than Emergency".
The Trinamool Congress had refused to leave her office in Kolkata till the Armymen were withdrawn from toll plazas, and had asked whether it was an "army coup", drawing sharp reaction from the Centre.
Terming it as "avoidable controversy" over the exercise carried out by the Eastern Command in West Bengal and other states under the jurisdiction to collect information about the movement of heavy vehicles at toll gates, Parrikar, in his letter to Banerjee dated December 8, said it is carried out by all formations of the army all across the country for many years.
He said the exercises are held as per the dates convenient to the army in consultation with agencies of the state government.
"I have been deeply pained by your allegations as reported in the media. If only you had enquired with the agencies concerned of the state government, you would have come to know of the extensive correspondence between the Army and the state agencies including the joint inspection of sites carried out by them," Parrikar said in his letter to Banerjee.
Describing Indian army as the "most disciplined institution of the country", he said the nation is proud of their "professionalism and apolitical conduct".
He added that the army authorities were forced to put the record straight in the matter by presenting evidence of their communication with the state agencies concerned including rescheduling of the data collection operations on their response.  **************************************************



Lucknow: The engineer was in the middle of his evening meditation session when a colleague called and told him to turn on the television. The Prime Minister was saying most of India’s cash would hold no value by morning.
The objective was to rid the country of illegal “black money” for which taxes had not been paid. Money often associated with illegal activity such as bribery. Money like the Rs 4.8 million stashed in a steel trunk, under a makeshift settee, in the engineer’s bedroom.
“For first few minutes I could not understand,” the engineer said, speaking to the Associated Press on condition of anonymity for fear of prosecution.
The engineer, employed by the public works department of northern Uttar Pradesh state, and many of his colleagues had amassed piles of cash by taking bribes for public contracts — a practice so common it has become accepted by many as part of the price of doing business in India. They felt confused — even betrayed — by the government cracking down.
“A bribe is not a taboo in a government job,” the engineer said.
Modi, in his Nov. 8 televised address, announced the demonetisation of India’s Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes, which made up 86 per cent of the country’s currency. He said it would wipe out rampant corruption, though in a country of 1.3 billion where most people don’t have bank accounts, it also wiped out legally collected savings.
“With this decision we have, in one stroke, hit at the root of the sources of corruption,” finance minister Arun Jaitley told TV channel Doordarshan a day after Modi announced the demonetisation. “We have freed up the country from these sources of corruption.”
Demonetised currency can be deposited in banks, but immediate access to those funds is severely limited and the government said it will severely penalise those who deposit amounts that don’t match their income. Anyone depositing more than Rs 250,000 rupees over the next two months will be flagged for tax inspection.
On the phone with friends, the engineer said, “I sensed desperation in their voices. I knew they also had bribe money” in amounts high enough to raise red flags. Did he feel shame, or guilt? No.
“Taking this extra money as commission is a necessity” just to meet expected payments and to advance in one’s field, he said while calmly sipping whisky and adjusting the light from an overhead chandelier by remote in his home in Lucknow, the state capital.
Each festive season, he said he’s expected to offer costly gifts like wristwatches, fine suits and gold pendants to his superiors, and even their sons. “One needs to keep them happy... but would you expect me to give a gift from my salary? No, never.”
The engineer said the bribes he accepts are most often already written into price estimates for projects like road construction as a so-called commission. “You do not have to ask for it,” he said.
Illicit money changes hands at nearly every project stage, from the public tender to completion. Almost everyone benefits from the “commissions,” from the highest ministers to the rank and file, he said.
“What I get as bribe is nothing compared to what others take,” he said, noting the palatial homes near his more modest house in an up-market Lucknow neighborhood. “I have a small hatchback car while others roam around in sedans and SUVs. Don’t our superiors notice this?”
Graft in India is so accepted that it is out in the open. On Sept. 4, another Uttar Pradesh bureaucrat named Ashok Kumar told reporters in the town of Basti, southeast of Lucknow, that he was giving up on becoming a district magistrate because he did not have Rs 7 million ($103,000) to pay the bribe. Kumar was suspended from his job in the National Integration Department after making the statement, though he never revealed who would have been taking that bribe.
The fight against corruption has been frustrating for retired bureaucrat S.P. Singh, who spent more than 30 years in India’s civil service trying to rid government departments of graft.
“The tendency to take bribe stems from a desire to have best in life,” he said. “The lure of lucre is so intense.”
Part of the problem, he said, was that politicians were in cahoots with bureaucrats to keep bribery schemes secret. “A bureaucrat helps an illiterate politician in making money by bending rules. Acting as conduit, he ends up thinking, if a minister can make money why not he,” Singh said. “The rot has set in.”
On Tuesday, Modi lambasted critics of the demonetization drive by saying they want graft to continue.
“Values in public life are eroding... I see that people in public life are giving speeches in support of corruption and black money. They are brazenly out in open doing so. In any country, erosion in values is the biggest crisis,” he said during a book release event in New Delhi, according to Press Trust of India.
Yet there are doubts about whether the demonetization drive will truly make an impact on corruption and tax evasion. India’s underground economy is so big it accounts for up to a quarter of the country’s gross domestic product. And many of those possessing piles of black money have come up with ways to save much of it without drawing government attention.
Some have bought gold, sending gold prices soaring. Some were buying U.S. dollars or euros. Some have used cash for down payments on new apartments, with obliging real estate firms back-dating the invoices to before the currency overhaul. Some have bought expensive first-class train tickets to be canceled later for cash, once enough new notes are printed. The engineer, despite his initial panic, said he did manage to find a way to launder his savings. What was it? He won’t say.  **************************************************



Moradabad: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday said he is working on a formula on how to send the corrupt to jail who deposited their money in Jan Dhan accounts of poor after demonetization and ensure this money goes to the poor households.
Responding to criticism over long queues outside banks and ATMS since the note ban decision on November 8, he accused his rivals of trying to "spread disinformation and despair" and said "this will be the last queue for the people who have been standing in line for the last 70 years for their daily needs".
"All those who are Jan Dhan account holders, you should not return the money that others have put in your accounts. If you promise to do so, I am working hard on to devise a formula to send all those who deposited their money illegally into your accounts to jail and to ensure the money goes to the poor households," Modi said addressing a public rally here.
Jan Dhan accounts were opened under a special campaign for providing banking facilities to the poor launched by the Modi Government in August, 2014.
He said the corrupt rich are not doing any favour, as they have looted this money from the poor in all these years. "I salute the people of the country for standing for long hours in queues.”
"I want to ask those politicians who are crying over these long queues.”
"You kept the entire nation in queues for 70 years after independence, as one had to stand in lines for even sugar, kerosene and wheat in the past. This is the last queue to end all those queues," he said to applause from the crowds.
The PM said only the honest can queue up outside the banks to deposit the money, while the corrupt are standing outside the houses of poor.
Modi said he was being hounded by his rivals as "culprit" on the note ban issue and pledged that this fight against the corrupt and corruption shall not stop "come what may".
"I am being hounded as if I have committed some crime by waging a battle against graft. But, what can my opponents do to me? I am a fakir (hermit)...jhola ley kar chaley jayenge (I will exit with my little belongings)," he said.
Modi was addressing BJP's Parivartan Yatra to mobilise public support ahead of the upcoming Assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh.
Tearing into the opposition, he said, "Some call me a culprit.... Is it a crime to fight corruption which is at the root cause of all ills prevailing in the country for the past 70 years?"
Without naming any party, Modi made a subtle reference to Congress when he said that the 1.25 crore people were his leaders and he had no high command.
"You are my leader...I have no high command," he said. His attack against the opposition came in the backdrop of their protests inside and outside Parliament on note ban, where the Winter Session has so far been almost washed out with the uproar eclipsing the proceedings every day.
Talking tough, Modi said corruption will not go on its own and has to be wiped out.
Modi said many governments in the past made announcements but this is the first government which gives an account of the work done to the people of the country.
The Prime Minister said government should not be merely for making announcements. It should launch schemes and ensure their effective implementation.
Attacking the opposition, he said parties in power in the past had worked only for themselves and for their near ones, but not for the poor.
"I had announced from Red Fort that power will reach 18,000 villages deprived of it in 1,000 days. There were over 1,000 villages in Uttar Pradesh alone. In half the time, over 950 villages have been taken care of," he claimed.
He rued that corruption has snatched rights of the poor and said, "Shouldn't I fight corruption? Is fighting corruption a crime? Why are some people calling me a wrong doer for fighting corruption."
Asking the poor not to withdraw any money from their Jandhan accounts, he said, "I will fix those who used to chant 'money, money' earlier and are now saying 'Modi, Modi'."
Modi said his decision to ban notes did not go down well with the corrupt as they were facing the pinch.
He said the rich do not have the strength to stand in queues and are thus queuing up outside the homes of the poor for depositing their money into their accounts.
"The dishonest people are unable to go to banks and deposit their ill-gotten wealth. They are the ones complaining against the government's demonetization move," he said.
"Today the dishonest are queuing up outside the houses of the poor after demonetization for their help through the Jan Dhan accounts," he said.
"The corrupt and rich people have asked poor villagers to safeguard their money for them, to stand in lines and deposit it in banks for them. Instead of standing in queues at banks, they are standing in queues outside the houses of the poor," the prime minister said.
"Those who have money to hide are the ones blaming me," he said, asking the gathering, "Should I not fight corruption? Will corruption disappear by itself?"
The common man is fed up with corruption and "if people come to know the intentions are good, they are ready to face any challenge", he said referring to those standing in long queues outside banks and ATMs.
Asking people to go digital, Modi told them to use their mobile phone as their wallet and there was no need to use cash. "People will not forgive the corrupt, the country has to be rid of all ills during the past 70 years," he said.
Modi reminded BJP volunteers and party workers once again of the government's assurance that things will ease up after a period of 50 days. "I had said there will be hardships for now, but things will improve. You might have to stand in queues to withdraw money, but it's essential to eliminate corruption," he said, and cited instances of parents doling out heavy sums for admission of their children in schools and for higher studies. On shortage of currency notes, Modi suggested use of plastic money and to go cashless.
"There are 40 crore smartphones in the country today. Everything is available on mobile banking, net banking and through credit and debit cards. You just need to download an app on your phone, and for 40 crore people, everything is possible without visiting a bank or standing in queues," he said.
Modi also hit out at those saying people were resisting change or were technologically challenged, saying "they should remember that the same people elected a new government by pushing a button."
"Some people have lost glow on their faces... earlier they used to chant money-money, now they are chanting Modi-Modi," he said.
He said to eradicate poverty from country, it has to be removed first from big states like Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Maharashtra and West Bengal.
Modi cited the example of Madhya Pradesh to highlight the efficiency of BJP rule. "Madhya Pradesh was considered a 'Bimaru' state. But the people of MP gave BJP a chance. The state government there, led by Shivraj Singh Chouhan, has transformed the state. Today, Madhya Pradesh is a shining example of efficiency," he added.  **************************************************



New Delhi: The Congress on Monday accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi of not following the law in issuance of Rs 2,000 currency notes and vowed to raise the matter inside and outside Parliament.
Claiming that the PM had plunged the country into "financial anarchy", senior Congress leader Anand Sharma said the introduction of Rs 2,000 denomination notes is an "illegal act" as the the notification required to be issued under the RBI Act for printing new currency has not been issued, ignoring what is mandatory under the law.
He also hit out at the Government's move to put indelible ink on the fingers of those exchanging notes.
A united opposition will raise this issue vociferously in Parliament besides making it a subject for mass movement, the Congress said.
The Deputy Leader of Congress in Rajya Sabha alleged that the Prime Minister is consciously deflecting attention from key issues and "fooling poor masses by masquerading as a crusader against black money under the garb of nationalism" and said those supporting PM "and his apologists are illiterate in Constitution and in law."
"The Prime Minister is squarely responsible for plunging the country into financial anarchy. There is an undeclared financial emergency without invoking the provisions of Article 360 of the Constitution.
"The Prime Minister's sensational and theatrical announcement of November 8 on demonetization had no legal sanctity as the monetary policy is the domain of the Reserve Bank of India," Sharma said.
The introduction of Rs 2,000 currency denomination is an illegal act, since under the RBI Act no notification has been issued, and such issuance is mandatory before the introduction of a new currency note, he said.
"Circulation of this illegal new currency of Rs 2000 denomination contradicts government's move to control black money circulation and is a continued illegality," Sharma told PTI.
The Congress leader accused the Prime Minister of making misleading statements and violating the law and the Constitution multiple times.
In a scathing attack on the government for its move to put ink on fingers of common people exchanging notes, he said, "Even dictators have not done what this government has done.
"Only the Nazis branded people. Our citizens and foreign guests are also being branded for withdrawing money. It is a matter of shame and concern.Incredible India has been overnight converted into Indelible India," he alleged.
Sharma said the replacements of old notes of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 denomination are not yet ready and this scarcity has put people to inconvenience.
"It is inflicting great suffering on the people, especially the poor, the farmers and the total workforce of 33 crore Indians in the unorganised sector and the farm labour," he said.
He accused the Prime Minister of having besmirched the image of India internationally as a rules based country.
Major opposition parties have already come together in Parliament to take on the Government on the demonetization decision and its implementation.
Sharma said neither the PM nor the Finance Minister have any legal sanction or authority to prevent and deny people access to their own bank accounts and impose limits on the withdrawal from savings accounts of households, citizens and salaried employees.
"The opposition is justified and firm in its demand for a JPC probe on the selective leakage of government's move. This leakage is a violation of the secrecy and directly helped hoarders of black money, aided the laundering of money abroad and also diversion of investments through bullion, stocks, bonds and securities.
"We are firm and determined to take this to a logical conclusion and to expose the intent and actions of this government," Sharma said.
The former Union minister said the demonetization move had affected employment in a big way.
"This money belongs to the people and you are now making them beg for their own money. This has never happened in any country," he said.  **************************************************



The Kahaani 2 team can breathe easy. They no longer need to fear competition from Wajah Tum Ho, the erotic thriller with Gurmeet Choudhary and Sana Khan in the lead.
Confirming the sudden development Gurmeet says, “Yes, we took a collective decision on Monday night to postpone the release from December 2 to December 16. The main reason is the demonetization. It has had a crippling effect on the middle class’ buying power. They’ve no money to see movies at the moment.”
How then do they expect the situation to get better in two weeks? Also, how do they explain Dear Zindagi’s success? Gurmeet explains, “We have full faith in our product. We saw the film the other evening and know that we’ve a winning product on our hands. We’ll pump up the marketing and promotion for two extra weeks to make the film even more viewer-friendly. By then the monetary situation would also improve.”     **************************************************



Varanasi: In a scathing attack on opposition for stalling Parliament over demonetisation, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday alleged they were trying to "rescue the corrupt" like Pakistan gives cover fire to terrorists to cross border and said the note ban will expose the 'kala dhan' (black money) as well as 'kale mann' (ill-intentions) of many.
"Many people say I had not taken account the consequences of this huge step. In fact, the only thing that I could not take into account was the brazenness with which many political parties and leaders will come to the rescue of the corrupt. But I am happy that this drive aimed at eliminating 'kala dhan' has exposed so many 'kale mann'," Modi said.
The Prime Minister, who was on his first tour of his Lok Sabha constituency after Rs 500 and Rs 1000 notes were demonetized on November 8, was speaking at a function organised inside the Benares Hindu University campus.
Charging the opposition parties, who have been attacking the government over demonetization, with "brazenly standing in support of the corrupt and the dishonest", Modi compared their stalling of parliamentary proceedings during the latest session to "firing at the borders by Pakistan in a bid to provide cover to infiltrators".
He also hit back at former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and P Chidambaram, saying their argument that promoting cashless economy was futile due to poverty, illiteracy and electricity not reaching villages in the country "exposes" their own report card.
Reacting to his predecessor Manmohan Singh's assertion in the Parliament that a cashless economy was not feasible for the country where nearly 50 per cent of people were poor, the Prime Minister said, "I wonder whether he was giving his own report card by admitting the dismal situation.
"After all, he has not just been the Prime Minister for two terms and a Finance Minister previously. Since the 1970s he has been holding key positions".
Taking on former Finance Minister Chidambaram over his assertion that online transactions could not find wide acceptance in India since nearly half of its villages were not even electrified, Modi said "whose faults is he pointing at. Did I uproot electric poles or snap cables in villages which had electricity".
He also took potshots at Rahul Gandhi's assertion that payments through cards, online transfers etc. would face hurdles in the country due to low literacy levels, saying, "I hope he does not say that I had indulged in some sort of black magic to make illiterate those who knew how to read and write. "He never thinks before he speaks and he may not have realized that he has admitted the failure of the long reign of his own party."
Calling himself "Kashi ka bachcha" (a child of Kashi), Modi said, "I am, nonetheless, delighted to see that the power of this holy land has made me work and forced detractors to admit, even if unwittingly, their failures".  **************************************************



Kolkata: Continuing her attack against the demonetisation decision of the Narendra Modi government  chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Tuesday described this  as a “visionless policy” which has come as a major setback for the employees in various sectors.
Ms Banerjee stated that  it has affected about 5 crores workers in the country and  termed it as a major setback for the employees since independence.
“Crores of people have become victims of visionless policy.It’s a major catastrophe.The draconian decision of demonetization by the Central Government has drastically affected about 5 Crore workers in the country.It is indeed a major setback for the employees since independence.” Ms Banerjee posted on her twitter  page through  a link on  her Facebook page.
The chief minister further posted that according to reports, around 1.25 Crore workers in the country in unorganized sector, e-commerce, leather, jute, textiles, glass, beedi, gems and jewellery sectors and daily wage earners under government schemes like MNREGA have either lost jobs or have been seriously affected due to cash crunch. She also expressed her concern and apprehension with retrenchment process going on in big industries. which will render huge number of workers jobless.”In big industries, retrenchment process is going on which has made or will make huge number of workers jobless,” she posted.
Ms Banerjee, who has been vocal against Prime Minister Narendra Modi since his announcement of demonetisation saying that the common people have been the worst sufferers, wrote on social networking website, “I can feel with deep sorrow the extensive sufferings and ordeal that these people are going through now.”  **************************************************



New Delhi: The BJP and the Trinamul Congress won two Lok Sabha seats each, claiming it was a vindication of their stand on the demonetisation issue, as ruling parties in six states and Union Territory Puducherry swept byelections, retaining most of the 10 Assembly seats up for grabs.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi thanked people for expressing “continued faith” in the BJP and its “unwavering focus on development and good governance” following his party’s success in the first elections after the government’s move to scrap high-value currencies.
West Bengal chief minister and TMC supremo Mamata Banerjee, however, termed the byelection result a mandate against the Centre’s decision to replace Rs 1,000 and Rs 500 banknotes.
The government has said people support the November 8 move despite some inconvenience as the target is black money, corruption and counterfeit currency. Opposition parties have claimed deaths in winding queues before banks and ATMs to deposit old notes or just to withdraw cash have turned people against the government.
“The by-election result is a befitting reply to the anti-people demonetisation. It’s a people’s revolt, rather a mass revolt against the Centre,” she said in Kolkata before leaving for Delhi to join the Opposition protests.
In the Assembly bypolls held on November 19, results of which were declared on Tuesday, the BJP and the AIADMK won three seats each, the CPI(M) got two, while the Congress and the Trinamool bagged one each.
The BJP won Lakhimpur Lok Sabha seat in Assam, vacated by chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal, and Shahdol Lok Sabha seat in Madhya Pradesh, both ruled by the party.
The Trinamool Congress swept Tamluk and Coochbehar Lok Sabha constituencies in West Bengal by whopping margins. The party also won Monteswar assembly seat with candidates of CPI(M), Congress and BJP losing their deposits.
In Madhya Pradesh, the BJP’s victory margin in Shahdol Lok Sabha came down to 60,000 from 2,41,301 in the 2014 general elections. It bagged Nepanagar Assembly seat, where it increased its winning margin to 42,198 votes as against 22,178.
Ruling Rules
In Tamil Nadu, the AIADMK, whose supremo Jayalalithaa is hospitalised for two months, retained Thanjavur and Thirupparankundram Assembly seats and wrested Aravakkurichi seat from DMK by margins ranging from 20,000 votes to 42,000.
The ruling CPI(M) in Tripura wrested Barjala (SC) seat from the Congress and retained Khowai.
Senior Congress leader and Puducherry chief minister V Narayanasamy won the bypoll to Nellithope Assembly seat defeating AIADMK’s Om Sakthi Segar by a margin of 11,144 votes.
North East Democratic Alliance (NEDA) candidate Dasanglu Pul of the BJP won Hayuliang assembly bypoll in Arunachal Pradesh defeating her lone rival Yompi Kri, an independent candidate, by 942 votes.  **************************************************



Kushinagar (UP): Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday attacked previous governments at the Centre, saying that if agricultural reforms had been implemented earlier, the farmers and poor of the country would not have had to suffer for so long.
Speaking at a rally in Kushinagar of poll-bound Uttar Pradesh, the PM said that his government is dedicated to the poor, the farmers, scheduled castes and scheduled tribes.
“When my Govt took charge, cane farmers were owed Rs 12,000 crore. We made efforts to ensure they got paid in time. Dues were cleared to an extent,” Modi said.
Strong farmers and villages add strength to India. We did not let sugarcane farmers suffer. We waived loans of Rs 20,000 crore owed by them,” Modi said.
The PM said that farmers earlier had to stand in queues even in biting cold to procure urea, but the Central government had brought an end to this.
“Now, urea reaches the farmer’s field. Thefts have stopped because neem coating has been put over the urea,” he said.
Taking a shot at the UP government, Modi said that if they care about the farmers, they should implement the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Beema Yojana.
But in a cynical vein, the Prime Minister asserted that the Samajwadi Party government would not work for the farmers because it was not in their political interest.
Pitching for a cashless economy, the Prime Minister stated that people can use mobile banking with the ease that they send messages on Whatsapp.
On demonetization, Modi said he had requested the people of the country to suffer inconvenience for just 50 days. “Wealthy people will have to bear more inconvenience, the poor less,” Modi said.
Slamming the Opposition for calling a Bharat Bandh on Monday, Modi said that while the government wanted to stop corruption, the Opposition wanted to stop the country from functioning.
“Your money is always yours. You can spend it even without cash transactions. It is the black money hoarders who need cash and who are most affected by demonetization,” Modi claimed.
While the whole world was moving towards a cashless future, India had been left behind so far, the PM claimed.  **************************************************



 Officials added that almost over 100 tax sleuths along with police officials have been roped in for the survey operations.

 New Delhi: The Income Tax department on Thursday conducted multiple raids in Delhi, Mumbai and other cities in the wake of reports of alleged profiteering and subsequent tax evasion by traders by converting withdrawn currency notes in an illegal manner.Interestingly, the operations (surveys) were launched from the evening as the taxman wanted some hard cash to get accumulated at the payment counters to make the action effective. Officials said the operations are being carried out at least at four locations in the national capital including popular market places like Karol Bagh, Dariba Kalan and Chandni Chowk, three locations in Mumbai and few others in Chandigarh and Ludhiana.Till reports came in, similar survey operations by I-T authorities are also understood to have been launched in two south Indian cities. Sources said the department had received "actionable inputs" that some traders, jewellers, currency exchanges and hawala dealers were allegedly exploiting the recent currency demonetisation of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes and were changing currencies at "discounted" prices, thereby profiteering illegally.They said the operations were planned after CBDT Chairman Sushil Chandra on Wednesday asked all the investigation units in the country to keep a check on suspicious movement of huge cash and other illegal transactions leading to tax evasion. Officials added that almost over 100 tax sleuths along with police officials have been roped in for the survey operations. At few places, they said, some preliminary documents have been seized. Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on Thursday assured people that taxman will not hound those making small deposits in scrapped Rs 500/1,000 currency adding, however, people with "large amounts of undisclosed monies will have to face the consequences under the tax laws".Top I-T department officials had yesterday said the government's directive to them is "very clear", saying any instance of tax evasion and black money should be dealt with strictly, especially after two opportunities in the form of one-time stash declaration window has been provided. In a surprise move, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had on November 8 announced demonetization of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes and introduction of the new Rs 500 and Rs 2,000 ones with additional security features.  **************************************************



New Delhi: The demonetisation exercise by the Modi government has brought a rarely seen unity among opposition parties, but they stand divided over the way they would protest against the measure tomorrow.
While the Left parties, including the CPI(M) and CPI have called a 12-hour bandh to protest against demonetisation of old high-value currency notes in West Bengal, Mamata Banerjee's TMC will not join it and only hold protests.
The Congress too has decided not to go for a bandh.
Leader of Opposition in the Rajya Sabha, Ghulam Nabi Azad, on Monday denied that any all-India bandh call had been given by the opposition parties against demonetisation.
Criticising the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), he claimed that the saffron party has the maximum amount of black money.
"The maximum amount of black money is with the BJP. Before criticizing other parties, they should introspect first. As far as the Bharat Bandh is concerned, nobody has spoken about a Bharat Bandh. We have not taken any call on or for a Bharat Bandh," said Azad.
Senior party leader Jairam Ramesh said no 'Bharat Bandh' has been called by the party which will hold nation-wide protests as part of 'Jan Aakrosh Diwas'.
The JD(U) has decided not to participate in the protests by opposition parties on Monday or West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee's proposed dharna in Patna on November 30 after its leader and Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar welcomed the demonetisation decision.
"We have supported he Centre's demonetisation move. How can we oppose or be the part of activity like bandh which is meant to protest the issue which our party has strongly supported," Bihar unit JD(U) President Bashishtha Narayan Singh said.
"JD(U) will not be part of any agitation against demonetisation including the dharna by Mamata Banerjee on November 30 in Patna," party Secretary General K C Tyagi said.
"We have taken an ideological position in favour of demonetisation so how can we be part of any agitation seeking its roll back," Tyagi said.
Odisha's ruling BJP will also not join the protests with its leader and Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik having hailed the demonetisation decision.
The opposition parties have been divided over the ways to protest against demonetisation ever since Mamata Banerjee decided to march to the President against it. While she was joined by AAP, National Conference and Shiv Sena, an NDA ally, other opposition parties stayed away. Shiv Sena has backed demonetisation but is unhappy over the way it was causing problems to people.
Mamata's TMC and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal's AAP are the only parties which have demanded a roll back of the exercise, while other parties have voiced displeasure over the way it was being implemented which was causing hardship to common people.  **************************************************



New Delhi: Somewhat rattled by the aggressive stance adopted by the Opposition over the demonetisation move, the government has initiated a back-channel dialogue with select leaders, particularly those of Trinamul Congress and the Congress. Parliamentary affairs minister Ananth Kumar, who met the leaders of  both parties Wednesday evening, will continue his efforts on Thursday.
After Wednesday’s meeting, Mr Kumar said he told the Congress and TMC leaders that the government had been saying it was willing and ready to listen to their concerns. “I have again requested them to start discussions where they can express their viewpoints, which the government will listen to and consider,” Mr Kumar said. The Opposition parties have, meanwhile, decided to observe November 28 as “Aakrosh Divas”, when nationwide protests will be held. Information and broadcasting minister M. Venkaiah Naidu again reiterated on Wednesday that there will be “no rollback” of the demonetisation, and he added: “Modi never rolls back any of his decisions.”
Both the Congress and TMC leaders have been leading the charge and have managed to unite almost the entire Opposition against the Narendra Modi government over the demonetisation issue. It was the Trinamul supremo Mamata Banerjee’s aggressive tactics and her success in drawing the Opposition parties to her platform that had become a major cause of concern for the government. The TMC chief’s posturing and her efforts to form and lead a possible federal front in the near future has also rung alarm bells in the saffron camp.
Ms Banerjee, who had taken on the government over the controversial decision since the first day of the Winter Session of Parliament, held a protest rally at Jantar Mantar here on Wednesday along with leaders of  the Samajwadi Party, JD(U), NCP and AAP.
What raised eyebrows in particular was that leaders from Hardik Patel’s outfit Patidar Anamat Andolon Samity had also shared the dais with her.
Inside the Parliament complex over 200 MPs from gathered in front of the Gandhi statue, and stood shoulder to shoulder against the demonetisation move. Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi was also a part of this dharna inside the Parliament complex.
On Wednesday evening, rumours flew thick and fast that the PMO had invited Mr Sudip Bandopadhyay, TMC leader in the Lok Sabha, to arrange a meeting between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Ms Banerjee. When asked about this, Ms Banerjee said “this is a democracy, and dialogue is an essential part of democracy”. But later Mr Bandopadhyay denied that he had been invited by the PMO. Mr Bandopadhyay tweeted: “I was shocked to see reports in a section of the media that there were calls from the PMO for a meeting with my leader (Mamata). There is no truth in this.”
When contacted, senior TMC leader and Lok Sabha MP Sultan Ahmed made it clear there was no way his party would agree to give up the agitation. “The Opposition and the ruling party have reached a point of no return over this issue. We will not back down. We are going to fight for the common people and poor people who are facing major hardship over the demonetisation move,” Mr Ahmed told this newspaper.
Addressing the Jantar Mantar protest rally, Ms Banerjee hit out at the Prime Minister, and compared him to (Nazi dictator) Hitler. She thundered: “Loktantra mein aise nahin chalta hai” (This does not work in a democracy). Flanked by other Opposition leaders, Ms Banerjee lashed out: “First they took votes in the name of acche din, then they took notes.”
In her characteristic flamboyant manner, Ms Baneerjee then declared: “I will not end my protest even if they shoot me.” She claimed that there was a “hidden agenda” behind the December 30 deadline for the surrender of the demonetised currency notes.
Inside the Parliament complex, Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi, the star attraction at the Opposition’s show of strength at the Gandhi statue, called the scrapping of Rs 1,000 and Rs 500 notes as the world’s biggest “impromptu financial experiment”. He and the other parties at the protest reiterated their demand for a Joint Parliamentary Committee probe into the demonetisation. Mr Gandhi also alleged that the decision had been leaked to a number of businessmen and industrialist friends of the BJP before the announcement.
“What the PM has done is the biggest impromptu financial experiment in the world. He did not ask anyone. The finance minister did not know. The chief economic adviser did not know. This decision is not that of the finance minister. This is the Prime Minister’s decision,” he said, adding that the PM was scared of speaking in the House.
“The Prime Minister can give lectures at pop concerts where naach gaana is going on. (But) 200 MPs are saying they want to tell the nation why he took this decision. PM does not want to come to Parliament. Why is the PM afraid? He is obviously anxious about something,” Mr Gandhi said. The Opposition’s show of strength included the Samajwadi Party, Bahujan Samaj Party, TMC, DMK, CPI and CPI(M), besides the Congress.  **************************************************



Guwahati: The unified command of security forces has directed all banks and petrol pump owners in the frontier states of Northeast to refrain from accepting cash deposits of old currencies without confirming its sources.
Warning that action may be taken under the provisions of Section 17 of the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act against the bank officials found guilty, the unified command has also asked Arunachal Pradesh and Nagaland to direct all the banks to ensure that old currencies stashed with militant outfits are not deposited in the banks or exchanged.
Informing that the meeting of the unified command, chaired by Assam chief secretary V.P. Pipersenia, took stock of the situation, security sources present in the meeting told this newspaper that the security agencies were worried about the ongoing attempts of separatist outfits to exchange old currencies.
Indicating that militant outfits have old currencies stashed in huge quantity, security sources said that the unified command also decided to intensify counter-insurgency operations in frontier states.  The command expressed concerns over the free movement of ultras in Arunachal Pradesh and Nagaland.  **************************************************



Kolkata: Congress president Adhir Chowdhury on Monday demanded a court-monitored CBI inquiry into the child trafficking racket in the state.
Speaking about the police and CID officials busting such rackets, Mr Chowdhury said that there should be proper monitoring and tracking of private nursing homes in the city.
“West Bengal has topped the country in fake currency smuggling and violence against women and now it is on its way to achieving that spot in terms of child smuggling as well. It is impossible to believe that the administration had no clue about what was going on under its nose. We demand a CBI probe into the child smuggling racket under the supervision of a sitting judge to get to the root of the problem,” he said.
The leader informed that the Congress would soon launch a bigger movement against this menace until the culprits were booked.
Meanwhile, Mr Chowdhury asked the state government to procure more loans and help the common people during this “time of crisis”, referring to the Centre’s demonetisation drive.
“If need be, the state government should chalk out a plan and come to the aid of the people. The daily wage earners have been left without food thanks to the demonetisation policy of the Centre. They should be provided with rice, wheat and other essentials at a subsidised price. The state has already borrowed Rs 3.4 lakh crore and might as well borrow some more,” he said.  **************************************************




New Delhi: Earlier last month, the government had announced .75 per cent discount on purchase of fuel through card.
In a move that is bound to add some hurdles in commuting activities, the All India Petroleum Dealers Association has announced that petrol bunks across the country will stop accepting debit and credit cards effective from Sunday midnight. The announcement, which has come in the wake of banks levying a 1% transaction fee on card payments across all petrol pumps, will cause inconvenience to customers already experiencing cash shortages following the government's demonetization move.
All India Petroleum Dealers Association (AIPDA) president Ajay Bansal told TOI from Bengaluru that all pump owners are firm in their decision to withdraw card swipe machines from intervening midnight of Sunday and Monday.
 “We are operating on a very thin margin. We cannot afford this deduction. Hence we have no other go than stop accepting debit and credit cards,” Bansal said. When pointed that the dealers are going against government directions, Bansal said they have no other option. Bansal said the decision to stop accepting debit and credit cards had been conveyed to Petroleum Ministry and Finance Ministry officials, he said.
Following this, on Sunday, the Tamil Nadu Petroleum Dealers Association said it has received an intimation from banks about the 1% charge and has announced that it will not accept plastic money in protest of this move.
"We have suddenly received intimation from the bankers, reneging on their existing agreements with us, and for having decided to levy a Merchant Discount Rate (MDR) of 1% plus taxes on all transactions done at our outlets," KP Murali, President of the Association, said. This move was a 'unilateral' one by bankers who had installed card swipe machines at the fuel outlets, he added.
Protesting the move, Murali said their margins were fixed on a per kilolitre (KL) basis and that they did not have scope to absorb these charges. "We have specific mechanisms to compute the margin and these do not have any scope for Credit/Debit card MDR. This will lead to financial losses for the dealers," he said. Further, bankers were also "delaying payments" and not settling the entire dues, he alleged.
"The reconciliation of swipes to amount being credited to our accounts is causing a lot of hardships and losses to a large percentage of the dealer community," he said in a statement. "We will not be able to withstand the financial losses generated by these transactions and have decided to stop accepting Credit/Debit Cards from January 9, 2017," he added. Hyder Ali, the association General Secretary, asked, "How can we do our business with losses?" Murali said the dealers have requested Oil Marketing Companies and various authorities to intervene and address the situation.
Meanwhile, the announcement prompted the city motorists to rush to fuel outlets to fill their vehicle tanks by making payments through Debit and credit cards. Many motorists felt this will add to their difficulties with few ATMs dispensing cash due to demonetization.

New Delhi: In a show of strength, West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, backed by JD-U, SP, NCP and AAP, today held a demonstration against demonetization here and ramped up attack on Prime Minister Narendra Modi, alleging the country was not safe in his hands.
Addressing the gathering at Jantar Mantar, Banerjee alleged that abolition of high-value currency notes had heaped pain on people and snatched away democratic rights of almost every section of the society including farmers, youth, women, labourers and traders, besides halting the country's economic growth.
Accusing the BJP-led dispensation of "looting" the common man, she wondered why those having Swiss bank accounts were "not touched at all", and warned that people will teach a "good lesson" to the ruling party in the upcoming assembly polls for implementing a "black law".
"I can challenge that no one will vote for BJP. If I were you (PM), I would have apologised to the public. Why you are so egoistic? You have branded everyone in the country a black marketeer and have yourself turned into a saint," Banerjee said.
In his address, JD-U leader Sharad Yadav questioned the legality of the demonetisation exercise and challenged the Prime Minister to explain to the Parliament how the decision will benefit the country.
"Under which law have you enforced this measure? You are stopping a person from withdrawing his hard-earned money which is his fundamental right. Demonetisation has destroyed the business of small traders. Come to Parliament and explain the logic as to how it will curb black money," Yadav said.
The presence of Yadav at the protest assumes significance as his party had supported demonetisation.
The street protest was also addressed by SP's Dharmendra Yadav, AAP's Raghav Chadha and NCP's Majid Memon.
The West Bengal Chief Minister also lashed out at a group of people who were shouting pro-Modi slogans, alleging that they were sent to disrupt her public meeting and wondered what the police and administration were doing.
Referring to yesterday's bypoll results, the TMC chief said BJP's victory margins have come down significantly in Madhya Pradesh and that Modi has left the country in the lurch (Modiji ne desh ka barah baja diya)."
Banerjee said   she will continue her fight till woes of the people are not addressed, adding she will also support a country-wide protest called by the Opposition parties on November 28 against demonetisation.
Last week, Banerjee had addressed a rally against demonetisation along with Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal.  **************************************************



Mumbai: The Centre may have proposed that cash withdrawal facility be made available at nearly 2,500 petrol pumps in the country however Mumbai is still to feature in the list of places where the facility will be present.
The Centre on Thursday initially decided that the facility would be made available at 25,000 petrol pumps where there were cash swipe machines from State Bank of India. Later, it was decided to extend the facility to around 20,000 outlets having cash swipe machines from HDFC Bank, Citibank and ICICI Bank.
However, petrol pump owners were concerned that this would inconvenience customers. “The plan till now is only to target rural areas where traffic is not much. To have cash withdrawal facility in a city like Mumbai, proper mechanism is required and if the government provides the same, we will bring all stakeholders on board,” said Ravi Shinde, president, Petrol Dealers' Association of Mumbai.Meanwhile, Sahibrao Kamble, treasurer, Petrol Dealers’ Association of Mumbai, said, “We have also written a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi expressing reluctance over having cash withdrawal facility at petrol pumps. Already, there is a lot of panic  **************************************************



Chennai: The Income Tax department has seized at least Rs 106 crore in cash, including Rs 10 crore in new currency, and gold bars weighing 127 kg in searches at multiple locations in the city to check tax evasion post demonetization. This is the largest seizure of new currency notes after the old Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes were scrapped on November 8. The I-T operation had been launched on Thursday.
Officials said S Reddy, a contractor working with the state government, has claimed the entire money and the gold as his own and is being questioned. "127 kg gold in 1 kg bars and Rs 96 crore in old currency and Rs 10 crore in Rs 2,000 notes have been seized by the sleuths after the operation," top I-T department officials said, adding "this is an unprecedented amount that the tax department has seized in recent times".
The department carried out the searches based on intelligence inputs about the activities of Reddy and few others for the last few days. Officials said the agency was investigating how the new notes in such a large quantity were stashed by the individual. The bundles of the new Rs 2,000 had no banking slips on them. They said the I-T teams had launched operations on at least eight locations of a "syndicate" involved in currency conversion.
The officials said a number of documents related to financial transactions, entries of gold sale and records of sale/purchase have also been seized by the tax sleuths. At least three people of the alleged syndicate are being questioned while few others are under the radar, they said. "He (Reddy) is a contractor working with the state government. He is claiming the entire cash and gold to be his own. Further probe is on," they said.
The I-T department, they said, will share the case details with the Enforcement Directorate and CBI for further probe into money laundering and corruption angles. Some bank officials are also under the scanner of the taxman.
The tax department had made the largest seizure of Rs 5.7 crore cash in new notes in Bengaluru few days ago after which two other central probe agencies, the CBI and the Enforcement Directorate, had taken over the cases to probe instances of corruption, money laundering and large-scale hawala transactions in the wake of the currency scrap on November 8.
According to a report in NDTV, the main suspect Sekhar Reddy is a member of the trust that manages the Tirumala temple in Tirupati, and reportedly visited late Tamil Nadu chief minister Jayalalithaa in Apollo hospital with prasadam from the hill shrine.
Reddy is also reportedly close to the newly appointed state chief minister O Panneerselvam, and was photographed with him during the latter’s visit to Tirumala last year.
But AIADMK rubbished the links, and said that he was not associated with the party in any way whatsoever.  **************************************************



Caracas: A jetload of new currency finally arrived in Venezuela on Sunday after its delayed arrival sparked protests and looting that jolted President Nicolas Maduro’s unpopular government.
The government had briefly pulled from circulation the largest-denomination 100-bolivar bill without replacing it on Thursday, due to the delay.
People around the country took to the streets protesting, there was widespread looting in the south and the government boosted the number of troops on the streets.
Bolivar governor Francisco Rangel Gomez said one person had died and 262 people were detained in his state, where 3,200 soldiers were deployed to “restore order”.
The (100-bolivar) bill is worth about 15 US cents at the highest official rate, and until recently accounted for 77 percent of the cash in circulation in Venezuela.
Venezuela has the world’s highest inflation rate. The government is trying to introduce new bills in much higher denominations since most people have to carry around bags full of cash for everyday transactions.
“There are 272 crates of 50,000 500-bolivar bills,” the Central Bank’s number-two official Jose Khan said on state-run television.
Khan said this first shipment would be followed by two more, adding up to 60 million units of the 500-bolivar bill.
Denominations of up to 20,000 bolivares are expected to follow.
Maduro blamed the delay on “US Treasury Department sabotage”. The bills were made in Sweden.
Maduro, a former bus driver, has presided over an unraveling of Venezuela’s oil-rich economy as crude prices have plunged. He and predecessor Hugo Chavez have made the economy increasingly state-led.
Citizens face long queues to buy basic supplies and inflation has soared.
Maduro’s government also blames speculators for hoarding the 100-bolivar bill. The country’s borders with Brazil and Colombia have been shut until January 2 in a bid to boost security and put a dent in black marketeering.
On Sunday, angry locals could be seen waiting to get through, many shouting at troops in riot gear. Many locals also rely on cross-border trade for their livelihoods.
Analysts have warned there is a risk of unrest in Venezuela, which Human Rights Watch says is in the grips of a “humanitarian crisis.” Anti-government protests in 2014 led to clashes that left 43 people dead.  **************************************************



Greater Noida: Upset over the lack of money at banks even after 22 days of demonetization, villagers at Bilaspur on Wednesday blocked the Noida-Sikandrabad road, affecting traffic for more than an hour.
The banks at Mandi Shyam Nagar in Dankaur displayed a 'no cash' notice and when the villagers reached there they were left agitated, according to reports.
Locals said the villagers then closed the banks' gates from outside and held protest even as some of them blocked traffic on the Noida-Sikandrabad road.
For one and half hour traffic was affected. Senior police officers reached site and pacified the villagers after which the blockade was lifted.
"For the last three days I have been visiting the bank to withdraw Rs 2,000 but am unable to get the money. Banks claim they are not getting cash. The ATMs too are without cash," said one of the villagers, Dharam Bhati.
Another villager, Raje, alleged, "Bank officials give money to their known persons out of turn while the common man after standing in queue for hours was told there was no cash and was sent back."
At Udyog Bandhu meeting held today at DM camp office in Noida, some industrialists raised the problems emerging due to demonetization before the district magistrate N P Singh.
"Small industries' production was affected. Though the government has allowed withdrawal of Rs 50,000 from current accounts but bank officials are refusing such withdrawals, saying there was no cash at banks," they claimed.  **************************************************



Moradabad: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday said he is working on a formula on how to send the corrupt to jail who deposited their money in Jan Dhan accounts of poor after demonetization and ensure this money goes to the poor households.
Responding to criticism over long queues outside banks and ATMS since the note ban decision on November 8, he accused his rivals of trying to "spread disinformation and despair" and said "this will be the last queue for the people who have been standing in line for the last 70 years for their daily needs".
"All those who are Jan Dhan account holders, you should not return the money that others have put in your accounts. If you promise to do so, I am working hard on to devise a formula to send all those who deposited their money illegally into your accounts to jail and to ensure the money goes to the poor households," Modi said addressing a public rally here.
Jan Dhan accounts were opened under a special campaign for providing banking facilities to the poor launched by the Modi Government in August, 2014.
He said the corrupt rich are not doing any favour, as they have looted this money from the poor in all these years. "I salute the people of the country for standing for long hours in queues.”
"I want to ask those politicians who are crying over these long queues.”
"You kept the entire nation in queues for 70 years after independence, as one had to stand in lines for even sugar, kerosene and wheat in the past. This is the last queue to end all those queues," he said to applause from the crowds.
The PM said only the honest can queue up outside the banks to deposit the money, while the corrupt are standing outside the houses of poor.
Modi said he was being hounded by his rivals as "culprit" on the note ban issue and pledged that this fight against the corrupt and corruption shall not stop "come what may".
"I am being hounded as if I have committed some crime by waging a battle against graft. But, what can my opponents do to me? I am a fakir (hermit)...jhola ley kar chaley jayenge (I will exit with my little belongings)," he said.
Modi was addressing BJP's Parivartan Yatra to mobilise public support ahead of the upcoming Assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh.
Tearing into the opposition, he said, "Some call me a culprit.... Is it a crime to fight corruption which is at the root cause of all ills prevailing in the country for the past 70 years?"
Without naming any party, Modi made a subtle reference to Congress when he said that the 1.25 crore people were his leaders and he had no high command.
"You are my leader...I have no high command," he said. His attack against the opposition came in the backdrop of their protests inside and outside Parliament on note ban, where the Winter Session has so far been almost washed out with the uproar eclipsing the proceedings every day.
Talking tough, Modi said corruption will not go on its own and has to be wiped out.
Modi said many governments in the past made announcements but this is the first government which gives an account of the work done to the people of the country.
The Prime Minister said government should not be merely for making announcements. It should launch schemes and ensure their effective implementation.
Attacking the opposition, he said parties in power in the past had worked only for themselves and for their near ones, but not for the poor.
"I had announced from Red Fort that power will reach 18,000 villages deprived of it in 1,000 days. There were over 1,000 villages in Uttar Pradesh alone. In half the time, over 950 villages have been taken care of," he claimed.
He rued that corruption has snatched rights of the poor and said, "Shouldn't I fight corruption? Is fighting corruption a crime? Why are some people calling me a wrong doer for fighting corruption."
Asking the poor not to withdraw any money from their Jandhan accounts, he said, "I will fix those who used to chant 'money, money' earlier and are now saying 'Modi, Modi'."
Modi said his decision to ban notes did not go down well with the corrupt as they were facing the pinch.
He said the rich do not have the strength to stand in queues and are thus queuing up outside the homes of the poor for depositing their money into their accounts.
"The dishonest people are unable to go to banks and deposit their ill-gotten wealth. They are the ones complaining against the government's demonetization move," he said.
"Today the dishonest are queuing up outside the houses of the poor after demonetization for their help through the Jan Dhan accounts," he said.
"The corrupt and rich people have asked poor villagers to safeguard their money for them, to stand in lines and deposit it in banks for them. Instead of standing in queues at banks, they are standing in queues outside the houses of the poor," the prime minister said.
"Those who have money to hide are the ones blaming me," he said, asking the gathering, "Should I not fight corruption? Will corruption disappear by itself?"
The common man is fed up with corruption and "if people come to know the intentions are good, they are ready to face any challenge", he said referring to those standing in long queues outside banks and ATMs.
Asking people to go digital, Modi told them to use their mobile phone as their wallet and there was no need to use cash. "People will not forgive the corrupt, the country has to be rid of all ills during the past 70 years," he said.
Modi reminded BJP volunteers and party workers once again of the government's assurance that things will ease up after a period of 50 days. "I had said there will be hardships for now, but things will improve. You might have to stand in queues to withdraw money, but it's essential to eliminate corruption," he said, and cited instances of parents doling out heavy sums for admission of their children in schools and for higher studies. On shortage of currency notes, Modi suggested use of plastic money and to go cashless.
"There are 40 crore smartphones in the country today. Everything is available on mobile banking, net banking and through credit and debit cards. You just need to download an app on your phone, and for 40 crore people, everything is possible without visiting a bank or standing in queues," he said.
Modi also hit out at those saying people were resisting change or were technologically challenged, saying "they should remember that the same people elected a new government by pushing a button."
"Some people have lost glow on their faces... earlier they used to chant money-money, now they are chanting Modi-Modi," he said.
He said to eradicate poverty from country, it has to be removed first from big states like Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Maharashtra and West Bengal.
Modi cited the example of Madhya Pradesh to highlight the efficiency of BJP rule. "Madhya Pradesh was considered a 'Bimaru' state. But the people of MP gave BJP a chance. The state government there, led by Shivraj Singh Chouhan, has transformed the state. Today, Madhya Pradesh is a shining example of efficiency," he added.  **************************************************



The demonistisation exercise being carried out by the government is set to impact the secondary sales market and luxury high-end segments in the residential real estate sector in the coming days as the cash component have traditionally been higher in these areas.
According to property consultant JLL India, the primary market in top cities, which is characterised by first time buyers, are expected to remain more or less unaffected.
“The legal banking/ financing channels have accounted for only a small part of all transactions in this space. The demonetization move is likely to result in luxury property prices dipping by as much as 25-30 per cent as sellers struggle to offload properties to generate liquidity.
“This means that luxury home buyers will suddenly have a much wider bandwidth of options to choose from,” said Ashwinder Raj Singh, CEO, residential services, JLL India.
With black money suddenly being wiped out of the market, Mr Singh believes that a lot of investors who have been investing in projects with unaccounted-for money — and raising prices to book profits — will get eliminated, thereby aiding a much-needed correction in the prices.  **************************************************



Jaipur: Much to the dismay of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s political opponents, India’s poor and labour class is convinced that demonetisation will bring lots of financial benefits and equality for them. Contrary to Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi’s allegation that demonetisation is devised to benefit the rich at the expense of poor, they have rather bought the PM’s promise of alleviating poverty.
These are basic findings of a survey conducted among daily labourers in Jaipur city last week that seeks to provide answer to the critics of demonetisation who are baffled as to why there was no visible anger among people.
Preliminary report of the survey “Impact of Demonetization on Casual Labour at the Chowkhtis of Jaipur” perhaps the first in the country was conducted by interns of People’s Union for Civil Liberties (PUCL) and Bharat Gyan Vigyan Samiti (BGVS). The report was released on Friday.
It found that people who have been supportive or rather not angry with the government because they are under false impression that money would flow into their account as the PM had announced that he would take away ill gotten wealth of the rich to distribute to the poor.
“People told us that at the end of 50-days, they would get money into their account although the figure varied from Rs 5000 to Rs 15,000,” said Tanaiy Tewari from Christ University, Bengaluru, one of the 65 students who took part in the survey that interviewed 700 casual labourers across 20 chowkhtis in Jaipur.
According to interns, during the interviews people told stories of miseries faced by them yet they said it was a good step. About 45 per cent thought it was a bad step while 28 per cent said that it was a good one. This is despite the fact that 95 per cent respondents admitted that after demonetisation there was big drop in employment as only one third people are able to find work that too at 40 per cent lower wages while 86 per cent complained of hunger. Yet, they felt that the trouble was worth it as not only will they get money but their loans too would be waived off.
Explaining this, activist Ashok Khandelwal who prepared questionnaire for the survey said that when even economists and experts differ on actual impact and scale of note ban how one can expect the poor and illiterate to think rationally. “They are susceptible to such propaganda,” he said.
Supporting him, Kavita Shrivastava of PUCL said that the findings clearly showed that these people are not even aware of what is black money and demonetization. “You can see that 36 percent people have no idea what black money is while 16 per cent think that it is money with rich people,” she said adding that this lack of knowledge about black money is what instrumental in their belief that demonetization would remove their poverty and bring them at par with the privileged class.
However, fear was also a major factor as many interns also said that that during the survey people were afraid to speak their mind in public. “Some people always came up whenever we began interviewing people,” they said.
Among the respondents around 36 per cent did not have bank accounts while of the 64 per cent who have bank accounts nearly half never been to bank.  **************************************************



Guwahati: After report of ongoing clandestine exchange of demonetised currency in several banks, Assam Director General of Police Mukesh Sahay in Guwahati on Thursday warned that anybody found aiding militant groups in converting old currencies into new ones would be booked under relevant terror funding laws.
Sahay told reporters that the Assam Police was keeping a close watch on such activities.
If some senior chartered accountants are to be believed, a section of bank managers of some nationalized banks in the state are pro-actively involved in clandestine exchange of currency by presenting fake identity proofs. 
The Special Director General of Police (Law and Order) Kula Saikia informed that there are reports about militant outfits getting their ill-gotten money converted through schoolchildren and educational institutions.
Saikia said, “They are also using schoolchildren and middlemen, including contractors, to get their old currencies exchanged. There are also attempts to get the money deposited in some fictitious accounts, which we are monitoring.”
Pointing out that security agencies are keeping a close watch on such transactions, Saikia said, “Assam Police had a meeting with officials of 13 banks and a senior representative of Reserve bank of India to discuss the issue and take preventive measures.” 
Claiming that police have succeeded in confiscating old currencies worth Rs. 2 crore in its drive, Saikia however said that demonetization has hit the insurgent groups very hard. “We have input that insurgent groups are desperate to exchange their ill-gotten money,” he said adding that role of bank was crucial.
Meanwhile, many chartered accountants of Guwahati claimed that some bank managers played key role in exchanging the corrupt money. Pointing out that at the initial days of demonetization a large number of people were keen on disclosing their black money, sources said that subsequently most of them got a window in the banks to exchange the currencies.  **************************************************




Gandhinagar: Business leaders from around the world attending an investment summit in the western Indian state of Gujarat this week cheered Prime Minister Narendra Modi's reforms, and said the disruption caused by his radical demonetization move should be temporary.
Executives at the week-long, biennial Vibrant Gujarat Summit held in Modi's home state said the tide was turning on investments into India, although some complained the approval process remained prohibitively slow.
Modi has promoted a business-friendly agenda since coming to power in 2014, and his reforms have helped turn India into the world's fastest growing major economy, albeit with the help of hefty government spending to fund projects.
"We are making a real bet on the country. What we are seeing with Prime Minister Modi is really some substantive change, it's more than lip service," said Peter Huntsman, Chief Executive of U.S. chemical maker Huntsman Corp.
Huntsman said his company, which sells products ranging from adhesives to industrial inputs, is doing "preliminary analysis on what may end up being several hundred million dollars worth of investments in India."
As someone who first came to India in the late 1980s and has seen the promises made over decades, he described the pace of change under Modi as "near light-speed", and said that an overhaul of India's unwieldy tax code would be a game changer.
After lengthy delays and political horse trading among lawmakers, Modi finally won parliamentary approval last year to implement the Goods and Services Tax (GST), although it is likely to go only some way to unifying rates.
The prime minister also stunned Indians on Nov. 8 when he abolished old 500 and 1,000 rupee notes in a bid to root out corruption and drag the nation into the age of digital payments.
The World Bank said in its report this week that the move would slow India's economic growth to 7 percent this fiscal year, down from an earlier estimate of 7.6 percent.
Other economists have also pared growth forecasts, as money shortages over the last two months have caused frustration for millions of people in an economy largely driven by cash.
Industrialists like B. K. Goenka, chairman of Indian conglomerate Welspun Group, believe the economic hit from so-called demonetization is in the past.
"Demonetization is over. It was a bold decision and in the long run it will benefit. It will also help the implementation of GST," said Goenka, adding moves to cleanse the system prior to implementing GST later this year made sense.
Welspun outlined proposed investments of 40 billion rupees ($588 million) in Gujarat during the summit, which ended Friday.
Risks and rewards
Canadian billionaire investor Prem Watsa said his India-focused investment vehicle Fairfax India (FIHu.TO) is raising a further $500 million, as its initial $1 billion raise from 2015 has already been largely earmarked for deployment.
"I'm saying India is the single best country to invest in worldwide for the long-term," said Watsa, adding that all the companies Fairfax India has invested in so far are registering double digit growth rates. "I see huge opportunities."
"You're going to see a transformation take place before your eyes in India," said Watsa, comparing Modi's reform agenda in India to the transformation Lee Kuan Yew brought to Singapore.
Even for optimists, though, challenges remain.
Fairfax India warned last week that a $323 million deal it had struck in March 2016 to acquire a 33 percent stake in the Bengaluru airport was still in limbo, awaiting some government and regulatory approvals.
That deal had initially been expected to close in mid-2016. (bit.ly/2jKJ7LV)
The head of Dubai's DP World, which operates several ports along India's coastline, said he was "very bullish" on India but that more work was needed to speed up approvals.
Others pointed to the unpredictability of Indian politics as a wild card factor.
That challenge was illustrated this week when Amazon.com (AMZN.O) was forced to remove doormats resembling the Indian flag from its Canadian website, after an Indian government threat to rescind visas of the company's employees if they did not stop selling them.
"Investors will just have to accept a higher level of risk to get the returns they want from big markets like India," said Amitabh Dubey, a political analyst at emerging markets advisory firm Trusted Sources.

New Delhi: The government increased the limit on cash withdrawals from bank accounts on Sunday to calm public anger as millions of people clamored for new rupee bills after a shock abolishment of large denomination notes. The decision was announced within hours of the government launching new Rs 500 notes in circulation.
The government relaxed cash withdrawal limits including removing a per-day cap of 10,000 rupees, increasing the weekly limit to 24,000 rupees from 20,000 and allowed exchange of bills over the counter at banks to reach 4,500 rupees instead of 4,000.
Large crowds were again gathered at banks across the country trying to change 500 and 1,000 rupee bills, demonetized by the government on Tuesday, in an effort to crack down on corruption.
Indian banks received 3 trillion rupees ($44.4 billion) of 500- and 1,000-rupee notes over the last four days, the Finance Ministry said in a statement, in a surge in liquidity in the banking system. Short term interest rates are expected to fall as a result.
The move to demonetize the large bills is designed to bring billions of dollars' worth of cash in unaccounted wealth into the mainstream economy, as well as dent the finances of militants who target the country and are suspected of using fake 500 rupee notes to fund operations.
The banned rupee notes made up more than 80 per cent of the currency in circulation, leaving millions without cash and threatening to bring much of the cash-driven economy to a halt.
The Reserve Bank of India said small denomination currency notes were available with both the central bank and with other lenders.
People "need not be anxious" and should not hoard bank notes because "cash is available when they need it", the RBI said in a statement. It also asked banks to provide details of cash withdrawn and exchanged daily, in contrast to fortnightly, to provide a better idea on circulation.
The measures came as people complained of lack of access to their accounts despite hours of waiting at banks as well as over the non-functioning of tens of thousands of ATMs not yet reconfigured for the new series of smaller-sized 2000 rupee bills.
A report said that the central bank's office in the western city of Ahmedabad was handing out coins in return for the old notes because it didn't have enough valid tender.
It showed a picture of a man emerging with plastic packets of coins of 10 rupees, underlining the banking system's struggle to make the transition to the new series of notes.
Narendra Modi, facing criticism from opposition groups for putting ordinary people into difficulties, promised further steps to rid the country of graft.
"I know the forces up against me, they may not let me live, they may ruin me because their loot of 70 years is in trouble, but I am prepared," he said in a speech in western seaside resort of Goa. The decision to demonetize the high value notes was planned in secrecy over the past 10 months, he said.
Modi came to power in 2014 with a mandate to boost economic growth and fight the corruption that taints large parts of political and business life.
So far, despite the rising difficulties people are facing, his crackdown on corruption is supported particularly among the middle-class which want action against the political and business elite for wrongdoing.
Anil Dalavi, a 32-year-old Mumbai resident with 20 rupees in his pocket who was waiting outside a bank, said he supported Modi's efforts to go after people with ill-gotten wealth.
"It has been tough for middle class people like us because we were caught completely unaware. But since this is a good move to flush out black money, I am willing to bear the pain."
Political Backlash
Modi's political opponents said they would unite to fight the demonetization move which had made lives difficult for millions of ordinary people.
"The government has spread anarchy in the country, the common man cannot buy daily products," said Mulayam Singh Yadav, leader of Samajwadi party, as crowds formed outside banks in Lucknow, the capital of the country's most populous state Uttar Pradesh. Yadav demanded Modi withdraw the decision to cancel the bank notes.
Uttar Pradesh, which holds state elections early next year, sends the largest number of legislators to India's national parliament.  **************************************************




Mumbai: Digital payment providers in India have mobilized hundreds of extra workers to enrol small merchants and offered their services for free, betting that severe cash shortages will prove to be the opportunity of a lifetime.
Signing people up, however, may be the easy part. Getting shops and customers to change their reliance on cash permanently will involve convincing people like Mohammad Javed, a 36-year-old meat shop owner in New Delhi.
Working out of a bustling market in the capital, he is surrounded by banks and ATM machines, but says he does not know how to use a credit card machine, let alone a mobile wallet.
He says business has dropped since Prime Minister Narendra Modi's shock move on Nov. 8 to ditch higher value banknotes, but Javed does not believe mobile app providers offer a solution to his problem - or to his customers.
"We don't have knowledge or resources to open a mobile wallet or card-swipe machine, and our customers who pay 100-200 rupees ($1.46-$2.92) are not interested either," he said.
Javed's reluctance is a reality check for the likes of Paytm and smaller rival MobiKwik, which have gone into promotional overdrive since Modi's announcement.
The prime minister, whose government supports digital payments, brought in demonetization to crack down on the shadow economy and improve tax collection.
"Why should India not make a beginning in creating a 'less-cash society?'," he said on Sunday, "Once we embark on our journey to create a 'less-cash society', the goal of 'cashless society' will not remain very far."
Promising Signs
The companies say results have been promising so far. Paytm, backed by Chinese Internet giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd, has added 700 sales representatives since Nov. 8, taking its number of agents to 5,000.
The company, which has 4,500 full-time employees, plans to double the number of agents to more than 10,000, as it aggressively expands its network.
It says it has nearly doubled the number of small merchants signed up to its services to 1.5 million in the last few weeks and added eight million clients to the 150 million it had before the banknote ban.
MobiKwik, whose backers include US venture capital firm Sequoia Capital and American Express, said it had increased its agent base to more than 10,000 from about 1,000 before the Modi move.
Merchants on its platform have risen to 250,000 from 150,000 previously, and chief executive Bipin Preet Singh said they were aiming for a million in up to two months. It has added 5 million accounts since Nov. 8, bringing the total to 40 million.
But challenges loom.
Credit Suisse estimates more than 90 percent of consumer purchases are made in cash, as millions still do not have bank accounts. Those who do have bank cards mainly use them to withdraw from cash machines.
Sales of cheap smartphones have boomed in recent years, but internet networks remain patchy, especially in rural India. Financial literacy and technology usage also remain low.
Dillip Kumar Agrahari, a vegetable seller in a Mumbai suburb, recently signed up to Paytm but does not know how to operate a smartphone.
He hopes switching to digital payments will improve his business as the cash crunch drags on, but says he will have to depend on a cousin to help with accounts.
Many businesses have traditionally opted for cash transactions because they are hard for the tax man to trace, given sales taxes are typically at least 10 percent.
Mangal Singh, a furniture store owner, said nearly 80 percent of his business was transacted in cash, even though he accepts credit card payments.
"We are working on wafer-thin margins," he said. "If we are asked to pay 12.5 percent tax and other charges, we will have to close down our shops."
Concerns also remain about the infrastructure for mobile payments, as customers or merchants from one platform cannot transfer payments to another.
MobiKwik said it had started offering wallet-to-wallet transfers, though not all rivals were on board.
When will profits come?
The challenges raise questions about whether the business models of mobile payments providers are sustainable.
Paytm recently slashed fees until Dec. 31, from a system of fees that ranged from 1 to 4 percent, with the most lucrative coming from telephone and utility bill payments.
MobiKwik is not charging fees until March 2017. The closely-held companies are loss-making.

Fitch Ratings believes that once the cash crunch subsides, some merchants and customers will go back to business as usual, using notes to pay for transactions.
"I would expect some amount of behavioral changes," said Fitch analyst Saswata Guha. "We're still not sure if this shock per se is incentive enough for them to completely change the way they do things."

Kushinagar (UP): Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday attacked previous governments at the Centre, saying that if agricultural reforms had been implemented earlier, the farmers and poor of the country would not have had to suffer for so long.
Speaking at a rally in Kushinagar of poll-bound Uttar Pradesh, the PM said that his government is dedicated to the poor, the farmers, scheduled castes and scheduled tribes.
“When my Govt took charge, cane farmers were owed Rs 12,000 crore. We made efforts to ensure they got paid in time. Dues were cleared to an extent,” Modi said.
Strong farmers and villages add strength to India. We did not let sugarcane farmers suffer. We waived loans of Rs 20,000 crore owed by them,” Modi said.
The PM said that farmers earlier had to stand in queues even in biting cold to procure urea, but the Central government had brought an end to this.
“Now, urea reaches the farmer’s field. Thefts have stopped because neem coating has been put over the urea,” he said.
Taking a shot at the UP government, Modi said that if they care about the farmers, they should implement the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Beema Yojana.
But in a cynical vein, the Prime Minister asserted that the Samajwadi Party government would not work for the farmers because it was not in their political interest.
Pitching for a cashless economy, the Prime Minister stated that people can use mobile banking with the ease that they send messages on Whatsapp.
On demonetization, Modi said he had requested the people of the country to suffer inconvenience for just 50 days. “Wealthy people will have to bear more inconvenience, the poor less,” Modi said.
Slamming the Opposition for calling a Bharat Bandh on Monday, Modi said that while the government wanted to stop corruption, the Opposition wanted to stop the country from functioning.
“Your money is always yours. You can spend it even without cash transactions. It is the black money hoarders who need cash and who are most affected by demonetization,” Modi claimed.
While the whole world was moving towards a cashless future, India had been left behind so far, the PM claimed.  **************************************************
