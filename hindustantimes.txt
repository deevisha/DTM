Indian citizens are not the only ones hit by the demonetization of Rs 500 and Rs 1000 banknotes. Pakistani refugees in Rajasthan have also taken a hard knock as they have no bank account or identity card and cannot exchange the old currency with the new ones. 
The Pakistani refugees, working in the private sector were paid monthly salaries in the first week of the month but following the demonetization announcement, they are finding it hard to make ends meet. 
Hindu Singh Sodha, the president of Seemant Lok Sangthan, an organization struggling for the rights of the Pakistani refugees in Rajasthan said not only the 17,000 refugees living in the state but also another 2 lakh other refugees across other parts of the country have adversely been hit by the government?s decision. 
In August, the union home ministry had issued a notification asking the state government to develop a policy mechanism for issuing bank account and driving license to the Pakistani refugees. But the Reserve Bank of India is yet to give the go-ahead for opening bank accounts for these refugees.
Sodha has demanded that some arrangements be put in place for the refugees to facilitate the exchange of currency. 
Dr. Rajkumar, who came to India in 2008 from Sangod area of Pakistan, is a dentist. He left Pakistan amid security threats. 
?It has become difficult for all the migrants who don?t have bank accounts. How can they change cash of few thousands which they keep with them for day to day expenses?? he said. 
Chetan Achu, a native of Tharparkar in Pakistan, is an engineer who moved to India four years ago. He works on contract basis. ?I used to get cash in instalments from my employers but now after this decision of demonetization, my employers say they cannot pay cash.? 
Dileep Singh, another refugee, said they approached banks but because they do not have any bank account or identity proof, banks have refused to exchange cash for them. ?We are shocked how we will be able to change our cash?? 
According to the Rajasthan?s home department, at least 17,896 Pak refugees are currently staying in Rajasthan. More than 15,000 of them live in Jodhpur alone. **************************************************



Cash supply to ATMs was expected to normalise by month-end and the Reserve Bank of India, which was monitoring the situation, could ease withdrawal restrictions, sources said.ATMs were getting around Rs 9,000 crore a day against Rs 2-3,000 crore in the early days of demonetisation, sources in banking sector said.?The cash situation has improved. The RBI is monitoring (situation) closely and a decision on withdrawal limits will be taken keeping in mind all parameters,? a government official, who did not wish to be identified, said. Prior to November 8, the day Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced scrapping of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 banknotes, around Rs 13,000 crore was fed daily into the country?s 220,000 ATMs.Read | 50 days of demonetisation: ATM queues shorter but ripples to remain in JanuaryThough cash situation is better, queues can still be seen outside several ATM kiosks, primarily due to withdrawal restrictions ?

Calling the government decision to demonetize higher denomination notes as a ?gimmick?, the CPI-M on Wednesday demanded the cost of withdrawing currency notes to be made public.
?This demonetization is attempted as a gimmick to divert attention from serious social and political failures of this government in the past 2.5 years,? CPI-M general secretary Sitaram Yechury tweeted.   
?What is the cost of withdrawing currency notes and replacing them with Rs 2,000 notes? Also, its economic and social costs must be made public,? he said, dubbing the move to be another ?jumla?.    
?What are the estimates of black money that will be curbed by this move? Government should make the figures public,? said the leader of the Communist Party of India-Marxist.  
As part of sweeping steps to battle black money, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced on Tuesday that Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 currency notes will cease to be legal tender from midnight of Tuesday.
Yechury said the move was ?poorly planned and not thought-through? and did not address the major sources of black money abroad or those invested in property, gold and such instruments.
?To uncover the illicit money trail, we demand that the government release the name of top 100 defaulters of bank loans,? added Yechury.   **************************************************


The sucking out of all currency notes of denomination Rs 500 and 1000 that formed 86% of all cash transactions could impact short-term consumption but will eventually benefit the country, finance minister Arun Jaitley said on Thursday. 
Underlining that individuals with large deposits will come under the scrutiny of the tax department, Jaitley pointed out that a large part of this cash was lying ?static.?
?There will be some constraint on small purchases for a few days, till there is adequacy of currency, but this would be beneficial in long run,? the finance minister said at the inaugural session of the Economic Editors? Conference. 
Read |?Deposits above Rs 2.5 lakh to be taxed, mismatch with income to draw penalty


Jaitley assured that the small depositors will not be subject to any harassment and kept outside any scrutiny. 
?It is only those with large amounts of undisclosed money who will have to face the consequences under existing laws,? he said. 
Jaitley said that temples and trusts, which receive hoards of cash, will also be subject to scrutiny. 
Replying to a question, the minister said that the impact of demonetization will also impact the real estate sector and gold consumption. Circulation of cash has been rampant in transactions in real estate and gold purchases. 
Chief economic adviser Arvind Subramanian said that the exercise to demonetise the high value currency notes will not amount to any reduction in wealth.

?Some unaccounted wealth will be impacted?instead of seeing it as a reduction of wealth, it must be seen as transfer of unaccounted wealth...a transfer of this unaccounted wealth from the private sector to the government and public sectors, which then will boost the economy,? Subramanian said.
Soon, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) will reintroduce currency notes of Rs 1,000 in a new design and different features. Besides, the currency notes of Rs 50 and 100 to would be introduced in new designs. 
However, Shaktikanta Das, secretary, department of economic affairs said that the existing currency notes of these denominations will not be demonetized. 
Meanwhile Jaitley, touching upon the issue of implementation of the goods and services tax (GST), said discussion and consensus would be the preferred option. The GST Council is slated to meet on November 24 and 25 to resolve the ?pending issues,? one of which is related to dual control. **************************************************


The government?s decision to scrap high-value currency has sent wholesale vegetable prices crashing to rock-bottom levels, bringing misery to millions of farmers hoping for good returns for their produce after two successive drought years.Onions sold for just Re 1 per kilogram in wholesale markets at Madhya Pradesh?s Neemuch and Mandsaur this week while tomatoes cost less than Rs 2 per kg in Andhra Pradesh and Chandigarh.A kilogram of cauliflower fetched farmers just Rs 3 in Bihar and potatoes cost Rs 3-5 per kilogram in wholesale markets in Uttar Pradesh.?I am ruined,? said Prem Patidar, a Neemuch farmer who sold his produce at one-fifth the production cost.The steep fall has forced farmers to discard their produce in Andhra Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh as they could not recover even transportation costs. Read |??My business will be finished?: Cash crunch hits farmers in Punjab?Yes, the prices in the wholesale markets have crashed,? an agriculture ministry official admitted but said any reports of farmers discarding produce was ?sporadic? and that the crisis would resolve soon. But, despite the price crash, consumers are unlikely to get any benefit as rates have not come down drastically in the retail market. Above-normal monsoon rains in most parts of central and northern India had fields sprawling with crops with farmers expecting to make up for the loss suffered in the last two years.But they suffered a setback when the government recalled Rs 1,000 and Rs 500 notes on November 8, triggering a nationwide cash crunch and a collapse in the demand for vegetables in wholesale markets.?The market is down by 30-50 % as consumer demand is low,? said Parneet Singh at Delhi?s Azadpur Mandi, Asia?s biggest fruit and vegetable wholesale market, adding that average horticulture output was also above normal.Compounding the problem is persistent refusal by truckers to ply on long routes such as Delhi-Mumbai as they don?t have enough cash to give drivers, most of whom are semi-literate and cannot operate digitally.

The BJP had opposed as ?anti-poor? a move by the RBI in January 2014 to withdraw currency notes issued before 2005 and said the move will not address the problem of black money. 
In power now, the BJP government demonetised Rs 500 and Rs 1000 currency notes on Tuesday and defended it as a move to deal with illicit wealth. Here is what it said then and now.
BJP spokesperson Meenakshi Lekhi in January 2014

? The idea is unexplainable as to why this has happened? the measure is strongly anti poor.
? The latest gimmick of finance ministry?s demonetization of currency notes before 2005 is basically an attempt to obfuscate the issue of black money that is stashed outside the country.
? The present government is not in a position to measure the correct quantum of black money, because those who have black money will actually convert it into new currency notes.
? The sufferers are the aam aaurat and aadmi; those who are illiterate, who have no access to banking facilities. They will be the ones who will be affected by such diversionary measures.
? People who have small savings and no bank accounts and their life savings will be targeted. The present scheme does nothing to remove black money from circulation. 
Watch |?Meenakshi Lekhi?s 2014 conference



BJP chief Amit Shah in November 2016

? Zara bhi nahi kiya tha. koi ek jagah pe bata de. Agar congress aise kehti hai to safeed jhoot bolti hai (we did not oppose (demonetization) a bit, tell us any place where we did it. If congress is claiming such, it is saying white lie)
? I can understand that dealers of black money, fake currency, hawala and drug are rattled. But I cannot fathom as to why leaders like Mulayam Singh Yadav, Mayawati and Arvind Kejriwal are joining the list of such people.
? The kind of environment these political parties are making I want to ask them if you are in support of black money, hawala operators, terrorism, fake currency dealers...SP, BSP, Arvind Kejriwal and Congress should answer this.
? The demonetisation move will do no harm to the poor. But some political parties have become poor.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi may meet leaders from a range of political parties on Monday in a proposed move to counter the Opposition?s growing criticism of his government?s decision to scrap two high-value banknotes.
The Opposition piled pressure on the government, while people?s patience wore thin as they waited in long queues for hours outside banks and ATM kiosks to withdraw money after 500- and 1,000-rupee pulled out of circulation from November 9.
The government is bracing for a stormy winter session when Parliament sits from November 16.
Congress leader Anand Sharma has given a suspension of business notice in the Rajya Sabha for discussion on demonetization of the two notes. The issue is likely to be raised in the Lok Sabha too.
?He (Modi) has scripted India?s financial chaos and anarchy,? Sharma said.
Junior home minister Kiren Rijiju responded to Sharma?s notice, saying the government would give a befitting reply.

The notes ban prompted Trinamool Congress chief Mamata Banerjee to ring up arch-rival Sitaram Yechury of the CPI(M) to seek ?united action? against the Centre. She also requested President Pranab Mukherjee to meet representatives of political parties on November 16 or 17.
Her Delhi counterpart, Arvind Kejriwal of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), appears to be on her side.
Kejriwal mocked at Modi?s appeal to people on Sunday to give him 50 days to fix the problems and ease their hardship. ?Are the people going to remain hungry for the next 50 days,? asked the Delhi chief minister, known to be a bitter rival of Modi.
Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi posted a series of sarcastic tweets on Modi?s emotional weekend speech in Goa. ?First laughter, now tears! Mediocrity comes face to face with reality.?
These tweets were in sequence with a previous tweet about a smiling Prime Minister posing in Japan, the country he visited after announcing the demonetization scheme on Tuesday evening.
?Modi laughs as poor cry,? Gandhi wrote.
In pictures | Impatience, disappointment grows as chaos outside banks continues


Fellow party leader Ahmed Patel uploaded a picture on Twitter of a long queue outside an ATM, in response to Modi?s comments that ?scamsters? were forced to stand in queues. ?Are these scamsters?? he asked.
The banned bills accounted for 86% of the money in circulation, leaving millions of people without cash and threatening to bring much of the cash-driven economy to a halt. Banks are working overtime to dispense cash, but the shortfall is too overwhelming.
The chaos, which the government promised will go away in about a month, has given BJP?s rivals a platform to unite before Parliament?s winter session. 
West Bengal chief minister Banerjee is looking at an ambitious front comprising the Trinamool, Samajwadi Party, AAP, Rashtriya Janata Dal and the Leftists to oppose the demonetization drive and demand a rollback.
Read |?Currency ban: The politics behind Modi?s big gamble


Parties such the Janata Dal (United) and Biju Janata Dal supported the withdrawal of the high-value notes, which is aimed at weeding out corruption, black money, counterfeits notes, and terrorist funding.
Sources said Banerjee was trying to communicate with leaders of ?all opposition parties?, including SP patriarch Mulayam Singh Yadav, RJD chief Lalu Prasad and Yechury.
She was apparently willing to sidestep temporarily a deep-seated rivalry with the CPI(M) for a joint campaign on a ?pro-people? issue. Yechury is believed to have told the Trinamool leader that he will discuss her proposal.
But the BJP can take heart from an apparent difference of opinion in the communist camp. A senior CPI(M) leader, parliamentarian Md Salim, termed Banerjee?s move a ?desperate call? to save her own party leaders engulfed by corruption allegations.
?Banerjee is the fountainhead of corruption. There is a nexus between Modibhai and Didibhai,? he said.
For his part, President Mukherjee has publicly supported the government?s move and appealed to the people not to panic.

Courage is often a misunderstanding of suicide or gamble. It appears that Prime Minister Narendra Modi, whose devotees are celebrating his ?boldness? for delegitimising large bills, has in fact made a calculated gamble. And it is turning out to be an excellent move. He has already gotten away with it, only the extent of his rewards is unclear.
This may not be apparent at first glance, especially if you are not very fond of him. There are communism-grade queues outside banks, which do not have enough cash to distribute. For the first time an Indian economic crisis is not about people being broke but about their inability to reach their sufficient or abundant money. There are stories of the old dying in the queues, the poor distraught, restaurants and malls bleeding, commercial sex workers unemployed.

There is no doubt that the citizens are furious, but they will not punish Modi for it. He did suspect that. He may not have been so confident about inflicting demonetisation in the summer months when people, especially in north India are prone to violence. 
Even though people have suffered greatly, and many have lost portions of their hard-earned illicit money, it is hard to dispute that the government has performed a moral act. Surprisingly, the government has been able to communicate the reasonable message widely and deeply. It is rare for people to have an accommodating view of a sudden policy that only has long-term benefits, especially one that has hurt them. But there is observable evidence that the general public is with Modi on this.

The hostile reactions to the cash crunch are understandable and worthy of respect, but some of the anger should amuse us. It reminds me of the men who used to burn the effigies of cricketers, including Sachin Tendulkar?s, after an Indian defeat. Journalists usually portrayed such extreme reactions as emotional outbursts of fans. In reality most of the effigy-burning was performed by bettors who had lost money on their emotional backing of India. Reactions to the demonetisation, too, contain the grief of hoarders clinging on to honourable reasons to be angry, reasons that they probably even believe to be true. 
An unknown portion of India?s unrecorded economy is run by politics. Parties receive cash through illegal means, which they then spend on illegitimate or nefarious activities, which include efforts to win elections. The important question is why does Modi?s BJP need less black money than other political parties? Is the party comparatively cleaner, or does it have more sophisticated systems in place, systems that a Putin would recognise? We will go there another day.
Read | There?s little connection between cash in economy and corruption


One strand of the moral outrage against demonetisation has been led by the refined urban class that dislikes Modi. They are excited by any story that assures them that Modi has made a catastrophic mistake. The reason why the story about the new Rs2,000 notes bleeding colour received good play in the social media even after the government pointed out that the notes are meant to lose colour, and that if they don?t they are counterfeit.
There is something clownish about the urban middle class. They keep whining about the state of the nation but when powerful solutions appear they reject them. They reject them because they are as corrupt and harmful as the aspects of the nation they despise. 
Not long ago they prayed for a clean, highly-educated politician who was not the genetic material of political dynasties; but when Arvind Kejriwal miraculously made an appearance they loved him only till he was a gadfly fast-until-orange-juice activist. When he turned out to be a sharp politician they suddenly wished to dismiss him as an ?anarchist?. In Delhi they keep whining about pollution but they do not tolerate any inconvenience to their car travel. Their grumblings about demonetisation are in line. Their lament cloaks the immediate prospect of the policy as a highly effective and even popular measure. 
Read | Demonetisation: Kejriwal says PM Modi using his mother for politics


A war against cash hoarding and illicit cash flow is also a war against disorder and informality, which means it is a war against two central qualities of the Indian way of life. Such wars against the Indianness of Indians can be destructive to politicians who wage them. But there can be great rewards, too, to those who take a chance. Some people may have theorised that the Delhi Metro, which sought to ban Indians from spitting and littering, would be defeated by rampaging mobs. Instead, commuters ended up appreciating how the Metro constricted their exceptional freedoms as Indians. It is highly likely that Indians would exhibit such a capacity for appreciation for Modi?s attempt to end an economic disorder. Also, he knows how to spin every economic good news in the coming months as a consequence of demonetisation. 
It is tempting to imagine what would have happened if the Congress government had taken the same step. Or say, if the Aam Aadmi Party, if it had been at the Centre, had made the move?

It may have been disastrous because of how the parties are perceived by the people. Modi, for now, has the charm to get away with many reforms that other politicians and parties cannot. We must use this man to get some difficult things done.

Tuesday night?s announcement of abolition of Rs 500 and Rs 1000 notes has sparked wide-ranging reactions from across the country. While many say they have been inconvenienced and are being forced to endure hardships, some have welcomed the move.
HT reporters spoke to people in various cities and towns to gauge the public mood.
Hyderabad:

-A Yadagiri Rao, 78, noted Telangana painter: ?Last night, I went home in a cab after my painting exhibition. The cab driver refused to accept Rs 500 note and I had no other currency. I had to borrow Rs 200 from my neighbour to pay him. I think Modi should have given at least 24 hours.?
-P Achyuta Rao, 55, rights activist: Perhaps Modi government is habituated to making such last- minute announcements, as it does on petrol and diesel price hike at the eleventh hour every fortnight. Such sudden announcement hit the common people hard.
-P Pavan, 45, Vijayawada: ?I may have to postpone my house-warming ceremony slated for November 11. I have no other currency, except of higher denominations. What can I do??
Chennai:

-Praveen Sudevan, 23, journalist: ?I usually eat from the dhabas that don?t accept card payments. I had around 400 bucks on me when the announcement was made. I think it?s a good move by the Centre to curb black money, but I also want to know how this move affects people less privileged such as domestic help and daily wage labourers.?
-Prabhakaran, 42, tea seller: ?I?m worried about this. It?s supposed to go after the black money that the rich have, but people like me earn and save differently from people like you. Most of what I make in a day?s work is in change - but what I save after a week?s rent and groceries is usually kept in Rs500 notes. I am confused about what to do - do I need to have a bank account to exchange the money??
-Shaktivelli, 50, domestic help: ?Whatever I manage to save after working and paying bills I usually keep in Rs 500 notes around the house. I have a small sum stashed away just in case - I was hoping to use it for my daughter?s wedding. I have no bank account, and am confused about what I should do now.?
Mumbai: 

Abhisekh Pandey, 35, employee at share broking firm: ?With ATMs shut for two days I am saving every piece of loose change on me?.
Satish Nayak: Owner, Idli House: ?Small restaurants are the major sufferers as we don?t accept credit cards and people are having problems in cash. Business is down 50% since morning.?
Punjab:

Rashmi Sandhu: ?I had a tough time paying to the cab driver. I had just Rs 5 00 note and the cab driver was not ready to accept it. After much pleading the driver accepted the currency. I don?t know how will we survive for next two days.?
Talwinder Kaur, wedding in family: ?We do not know how to manage the wedding shopping. For two days we are stuck with no ATMs functioning and banks closed. The government should have give us some time to make arrangements.?
Diwakar Sahoonja, trader: ?We are not accepting Rs 500 or Rs 1000 notes. We are encouraging people to pay through debit and credit cards. It is just an inconvenience for two days and we are hopeful the new notes will be circulated in the market after two days.? 
Alok Diwan, software professional and resident of Panchkula: ?We hardly have currency notes in denomination of Rs 100. The government did not give us time to plan. There are long queues outside petrol pumps and also they are not offering any change.? 
Shikha Sharma, housewife: ?I had gone to buy milk and bread in the morning but the vendor refused to accept Rs 500. There is panic all round and no one wants to take the burden of exchanging this denomination later.? 
Kolkata:
Subrata Shau: Businessman, 52: ?I am in deep trouble. I have a small manufacturing unit and a lot of transactions happen with cash. With the banks and ATMs closed and all Rs 500 and 1,000 notes out of circulation, my business will be terribly hit for a few days.?
Rina Sarkar: retired teacher: ?Only a few days ago I took out Rs 15,000 from the ATM for household expenditure. The entire money except Rs 500 -- five notes of Rs 100 -- emerged in Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes. I have no idea of what I am going to do now. The grocer flatly refused to accept the notes.?
Asesh Sengupta, entrepreneur, 41: ?I am supposed to withdraw money from my bank and make payments to a number of vendors as I am getting married on December 2 but I just can?t take out the money not only today, but for a number of days. If there is no way out, I may be forced to cancel the celebrations.?
Raipur:

-Rahul Divakar, 34, Bhilai: ?There is a marriage ceremony in my family in Bihar next week. I was assigned to buy many things but now I have no option. I have to deposit the cash and wait for the new currency. Each and every friend of mine is suffering from similar situation. What kind of decision is this? There should be a process and people should be given time before banning Rs 500 and Rs 1000 notes.? 
-Rajat Khare, Raipur resident: ?Rich people never stack notes, rather they cunningly invest in properties, shares, investment schemes and other kinds. It is the middle and lower class like us who stack or save cash and who will be badly affected by this decision.?
-Kamlesh Tiwari, tea shop owner in Raipur: ?I have to close my shop for next few days because I have no money to buy anything. I had four notes of Rs 500 (Rs 2000 cash) but it will not work now.?
Trade body reactions:

-Mahesh Singhania, chairman, Federation of West Bengal Trade Associations: ?I urge the trading fraternity to declare all India trade bandh & non-cooperation movement for the next 96 hours. The whole economy is bound to collapse at least up to the time the existing higher denomination notes get exchanged with the new currency papers. Educated people may be able to adjust or stand by this shock but not the uneducated ones.I appeal to the legal fraternity to file PIL.?
-Harshavardhan Neotia, president, FICCI: ?This is an extremely bold move by the PM and will have a debilitating impact on the parallel economy in the country as well as terror financing. FICCI completely supports this move of the government. ?There could be some inconvenience that this change may lead to for the people of our country for a few days. However, we are sure that government and RBI will take adequate measures to ensure that the transition happens smoothly.?
-Chiranjeev Singh, chairman of Chandigarh Beopar Mandal: ?The traders are authorised to deposit their sale proceeds into the banks. Small-time traders do not have much problem but the new currency should be supplied in market soon. Debit and credit cards are accetable. We will give credit and take payments later.
Jitendra Barlota, working president, Chhattisgarh Chamber of Commerce: ?Hundred rupee notes are difficult to find as most of time ATMs were giving out Rs 500 notes. Small traders were totally dependent upon Rs 500 and Rs 1000 notes, hence they will be suffering for next one month. Secondly, the consumer which is mainly middle class and lower class, will not be able to purchase goods because they have no cash.? 
-Ganapati Ramachandran, president-elect of South Indian Chamber of Commerce and Industry: ?It is a bold initiative but how efficient would it be, remains to be seen. It would be difficult to carry out business in the short run, but in the long run it would be beneficial. It will change the way business is done in India and India will conform to the globally accepted standards and practices.?
- CH Venkatachalam, General Seccretary, All India Bank Employees Association: The initiative will not help in fighting black money as it is stashed away in foreign banks, foreign currency, gold or other assets. Everyone knows that black money is mostly in foreign currency, in foreign banks, in gold or in properties and less in cash. Which is why, this would not help in detecting black money.?
-Vivek Sahu, spokesperson of Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT): ?This is really a surgical strike for businessmen. Businessmen have refused to accept the notes of denomination of Rs 500 and Rs 1000. The trading has stopped totally and buyers are also facing trouble in it.? 
-Prashant Bhatia: Ladhu Udyog Bharti, Uttar Pradesh: ?The decision of the government to abolish Rs 500 and Rs 1000 currency notes will help eliminate corruption and target black money. The problem for common man is temporary but those who have black money will face trouble, especially the politicians.?
Adarsh Shetty, president of Indian Hotels and Restaurant Association (AHAR), Mumbai: ?From morning, patrons eat and then pay us these scrapped notes. Even we have no change to pay them back.? **************************************************


Home minister Rajnath Singh said on Tuesday demonetisation has increased problems for Naxals, underlining that intelligence inputs suggest that they have weakened.The minister refused to give any specific estimates about the damage inflicted on the guerillas but said the information suggests that massive problems are being faced by them post notes ban.?It is correct that Naxals have weakened post demonetisation... The intelligence information received by us shows their problems have increased. Their strength has reduced,? Singh said.On November 8, the government had announced that Rs 1000 and Rs 500 notes ceased to be legal tender.When asked about the attack on women in Bengaluru on New Year?s eve, Singh said, ?It is not possible to keeping seeking reports from the state on every issue. I believe that protecting the modesty of women is the duty of every state government and they should take it seriously.?On the issue of recent riots in West Bengal, Singh said ministry is in the know of every big problem.?We don?t do politics of confrontation. We will talk it out,? he said when asked about reports of a rift between the West Bengal government and the Centre.He also refused to give any clear response whether his views were taken on the issue of demonetisation.Singh said efforts are going on to bring back Dawood Ibrahim but those cannot be disclosed in public.   **************************************************


India?s GDP data for the July-September quarter, to be released today in the next few hours is likely to be around 7.5%. It will bear no impact of the demonetisation exercise announced on November 8.Normal economic activity took place till October, so Wednesday?s data will reflect healthy growth, analysts said.The demonetization exercise ? leading to a sucking out of the high denomination notes of Rs 500 and 1000 will hit growth in the third quarter.?GDP numbers will be around 7.5% in the second quarter, that has been our projection and we see no change in the number but we will revise our third quarter projection..the demonetization exercise will definitely have a negative impact on the growth figures,? DK Joshi, chief economist, Crisil told HT.While think tanks vary on the quantum, the hit could be anywhere between 0.4%-0.5% for the third quarter, the second quarter will have no impact. However, National Institute of Public Finance and Policy (NIPFP) ? a research unit under the finance ministry has projected a contraction. HSBC has projected a hit of a percentage point for the whole fiscal. CARE said growth will be affected by 0.3-0.5% for the full year.  **************************************************

A PIL has been filed in the Allahabad High Court seeking crackdown on alleged laundering of black money in the aftermath of demonetization through cash donations to religious institutions and charitable trusts, many of these run by political leaders.
The PIL filed by advocate Avinash Mani Tripathi, which is likely to come up for hearing before a bench later this week, alleges that there has been emergence of a ?menace of converting black money into white through donation in cash? of ?old high denomination notes of Rs 500 and Rs 1000 in the accounts of religious and charitable trusts running across the country?.
The petitioner has contended that this would result in ?failure? of government?s attempt to ?eliminate black money? since donations made to religious institutions and trusts became a part of their income which was ?exempt from tax?.
The petitioner has also alleged ?inaction on part of Government of India to make any declaration regarding monetary effect of specified bank notes received in donation box or directly at religious institutions or trusts?.
It alleged that many of these were being ?run by political leaders,? including those belonging to the ruling parties at the Centre and in the state.
The petitioner has mentioned the names of institutions or trusts run by BJP MPs, an Uttar Pradesh cabinet minister, a former Union Minister from Congress and an AIMIM leader.
The petitioner, who has named the Centre and the Reserve Bank of India as parties, has prayed for ?directions to respondent authorities to declare that value of the old high denomination notes deposited in the accounts of religious institutions and trusts after November 08, 2016 would neither be credited nor exchanged?.
As an interim measure, pending hearing on the PIL, the petitioner has prayed for directions for ?constitution of a high-level committee for taking appropriate action against the menace of converting black money into white through donation in cash of old denomination notes in the accounts of religious institutions and trusts across the country?. **************************************************



D-for Donald Trump; D-for Demonetisation and D for Disruption. The Alphabet of the year 2016 self-selected itself; as did the word. Disruptive ideas defined the year gone by, throwing up an unexpected American President and back home a decision that one politician (who wants to remain unnamed) calls the ?single most dramatic change in our part of the world since Partition.?As hyperbolic as that claim may be, the truth is that very few of us can predict the scale and depth of change -- and havoc -- ?Notebandi? may bring. For the past month, like millions of Indians who have no special expertise in economics, I have tried to wrap my head around the currency purge. These are the commonsensical questions I have -- yes, you may even say D -- for Dumb -- that I have still found no good or convincing answers to.Read: Demonetisation woes: HT?s photo of old man crying in a bank touches a raw nerve? Was chocking black money the main goal of this demonetisation? While the government has continuously shifted goal posts on the actual aim of wiping out 86% of India?s currency -- and is now emphasizing digital payments more than netting the big sharks -- at least initially the decision was pitched as a ?surgical strike on corruption.? However, given that only an estimated 6% of India?s black money -- certainly less than 10% is the consensus -- is in cash, why is this pain worth the gain? If most tainted or hoarded money has already been channeled into gold, real estate, swiss banks and other tax havens, isn?t the primary hardship to those who in fact do pay their taxes or don?t even earn enough to qualify as the real targets of an anti-corruption program?Read: SC refuses to pass interim order on demonetisation, restrains HCs from hearing petitions? If there is greater chance of black money being hoarded in higher currency notes -- the logic for targeting the 500 and 1000 notes -- then why print the 2000 rupee note? By your own stated logic, wouldn?t the higher denomination notes restart the same cycle all over again -- as is already evident in the series of cash seizures where much of the money hoarded has been found in new notes? RSS ideologue S. Gurumurthy, believed to be in the inside loop on all demonetisation decisions, has already said his personal view is that even 2000 rupee notes should be phased out, arguing that they are an interim arrangement to meet the demand-supply mismatch. ? Hasn?t Demonetization created an elaborate opportunity for money laundering -- and enabled more corruption instead of less? Either that or the government grossly miscalculated the black money in circulation in 500 and 1000 rupee notes. Take a look at the latest numbers. The RBI confirms that 12. 44 lakh crores (of nearly 15 lakh crores which is the monetary value of the now-banned notes) is already back in bank deposits since the November 8th announcement. In other words, the government?s hope of a black money windfall that could have been transferred to welfare schemes has been belied. And if all of this money is not ?white? and depositers have conned the system, is the taxman now going to scrutinize every single transaction to scan for discrepancies? Similarly, a gigantic 37,000 crores surge in Jan Dhan accounts since the notes ban declaration underlines how many of India?s poor are probably being used as vehicles by their employers or by other touts -- to take a commission -- and whitewash the rest of the money with colours of legitimacy. Economists like Jagdish Bhagwati have contentiously argued that this should be seen as a ?redistribution? of wealth which will have an ?expansionary? impact; the Prime Minister himself has in a RobinHood-esque manner urged the poor to keep the money that is being funneled through them. But this militates against the bombastic claim of ending corruption; in fact it?s just another de-facto amnesty for those who have evaded taxes while leaving law abiding citizens standing in serpentine ATM queues. ? Finally, what happened to the Modi motto of ?Minimum Government; Maximum Governance?? Those who argued that the 2014 victory would usher in a modern right of center economics must concede they were wrong. Not just is the Prime Minister not a privatizer (focusing instead on increasing efficiency of public sector units), his demonetisation decision has given the State overweening powers of the kind not seen in years. In some ways, this phase could well be the return of ?Raid Raj?; where an Income Tax officer will now prowl about in your bedroom and bank locker to determine whether you -- as an unmarried, single woman -- have more gold than you should! Philosophically what disturbs me about demonetisation is the State having so much say in how tax-paying citizens access their own money. Yes, our strata of upper-middle class Indians can survive on plastic and are not suffering like those who earn (legitimately by the way) in cash -- the flower seller, the daily wage labourer, the railway coolie; the farm tiller; the bindi-maker; the neighbourhood plumber; the golgappa man down the road -- but even we have the right to worry about what sweeping powers to the tax authorities may mean for an India that was meant to minimise the intrusion of the State in our daily lives.

The demonetisation of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 banknotes is unlikely to help the government suck out black money
 from the economy as hoarders keep a tiny portion of their ill-gotten wealth in hard cash, going by income-tax data.
Cash recovery has been less than 6% of the undisclosed income seized from tax evaders, shows an HT analysis of data from tax raids from financial year 2012-13 onwards. 
In a move that received a mixed response, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced on Tuesday night a recall of the two currency denominations and set a 50-day deadline to exchange old banknotes with new at banks and post offices. Critics argued the move would do little to unearth black money hoarded by the rich who park their cash in different asset classes than keep it idle. 
Tax data seem to bear that out. For instance, in income-tax probes from April 1 to October 31 this financial year, black-money holders accepted having stashed Rs 7,700 crore worth of ill-gotten assets. The cash component was merely Rs 408 crore or 5%. The remaining was invested in business, stocks, real estate and benami bank accounts, the data show. Financial year 2015-16 saw the highest black-money detection in the period, of which 6% was cash.
The actual proportion of cash would be even lower as the tax department?s classification of seizures considers currency and ornaments as one unit. 
Read: Banks struggle to handle panicked customers, ATMs run dry within hours


One of the reasons why tax evaders and corrupt public officials prefer not to stash cash could be the sheer logistics of it. Rs 1 crore in Rs 1,000 notes, if stashed evenly, occupies one sq ft and weighs 13 kg. Rs 100 crore would weigh 1.3 tons and occupy an area the size of a three-wheeler goods carrier, making the movement of cash without detection difficult. 
Ill-gotten wealth mostly enters the formal economic system through real estate and shell companies, a finance ministry source said.
HT reported on Thursday the currency switch could result in hardship for low-income groups as only 28%-32% of Indians have access to financial institutions, including post offices and banks. Further, 33% of the 138,626 bank branches are in 60 Tier-1 and Tier-2 cities, leaving rural India at a huge disadvantage.

Can a debate on demonetisation under no rule save the winter session of Parliament?With barely a week left for the session, the Opposition is known to have proposed to the Lok Sabha Speaker Sumitra Mahajan to hold a debate on demonetization waiving off, albeit temporarily, all rules.The Speaker of Lok Sabha and the Chairman of Rajya Sabha have powers to allow a debate on any important issue without any rules.The Opposition initially wanted a debate which will entail voting. The government ruled this out fearing it will be outnumbered in Rajya Sabha.As the logjam continues, the new proposal has emerged as a middle-path.On Thursday, Congress chief whip in Lok Sabha, Jyotiraditya Scindia held a long conversation with Trinamool Congress? floor leader Sudip Bandopadhyay. While the Congress and the Trinamool are likely to back the plan for a rule-less debate, the stand of the other Opposition parties were unclear.Also on Thursday, Congress vice president Rahul Gandhi said that he wanted a debate in the House. ?We will catch the PM inside the House. He can?t run away from there,? Gandhi said, referring to the Opposition?s allegation that the PM is avoiding the House but speaking outside on demonetization.For past 16 days, the House has not been able to transact business, barring the passage of the supplementary budge allocations, due to Opposition?s disruptions. **************************************************


?But above all things, [the Prince] must keep his hands off the property of others, because men more quickly forget the death of their father than the loss of their patrimony.? 

-- Niccolo Machiavelli, The Prince

Historians will likely mark the current ?cash chaos? as one of the defining moments in independent India. This is the time to save up news reports and analysis pieces, besides tweets, Facebook posts and videos to absorb the enormity of what India is going through. Millions of Indians are making their way to banks to line up and exchange their useless Rs 500 and Rs 1000 notes; those in cities are luckier to find banks and ATMs within reasonable distance but they end up waiting for hours nonetheless. In rural areas, where 833 million Indians or 69% of the population lives, the journeys will be long and arduous. We are possibly seeing the greatest churning of the subcontinent?s population since the Partition of 1947.
The cash chaos is also perhaps the most economically and socially disruptive act of State the world has seen since the Cultural Revolution in China (1966-76). If you think that?s an exaggeration, do the math. Three in four rural households have incomes less than Rs 5,000 per month but there is a strong likelihood that a majority of them have a Rs 500 note that they need to change. To take a different angle, India has around 248 million households. Even if you assume that 50 million households (200 million people at an average of four per unit) are too poor to have a Rs 500 note, that is still around 200 million journeys to the bank that need to be immediately made. Members of families will be going to banks more than once before the end of December; millions are thus setting off in India and trudging in different directions, looking for cash just because the government made them. This is a time when all of India is being socialised by everyday experience to understand, interpret and, in many cases, disapprove of the NDA?s policy of demonetisation.
The government recognises this is a problem but it is attempting to paper it over by invoking the spirit of voluntarism and sacrifice. We are told that a measure of ?inconvenience? is necessary for the nation; temporary pain is ?for larger gain?, as parliamentary affairs minister Venkaiah Naidu put it. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has saluted his countrymen. ?People stood in line for four hours, six hours but accepted the decision in national interest the way people of Japan tackled the aftermath of the 2011 disaster... I never thought I will receive blessings for this,? the PM said while he was in Japan and subsequently asked the people to give him 50 days.

The Modi government is confident that it has infused this project with so much of moral meaning that people will forget their misery, come January. The assumption is that the poor and the middle class will respond to calls for sacrifice and be delighted that the wealth of the rich they know has suddenly come to nought ? and that that admiration for the PM will translate into support for the BJP in the coming months.
The BJP seems to have, however, not fully absorbed what it has unleashed. It has effectively put on hold an entire society?s means of exchange, without which it is impossible to procure essential goods and services like food, medicine and transport. It is like getting back to a form of living before the division of labour was invented. If you don?t grow your own food, you have no way of procuring it as the means of exchange does not exist. India?s communities are not capable of coping with such experiments, however ?temporary? the period is.
The real danger for the BJP is that its model of managing the narrative and influencing public opinion is likely to breakdown during this crisis. The Modi government has dominated India?s discourse through a focus on the PM, his upbeat rhetoric, actions and travel that are unfailingly relayed by the media. The BJP has also found a way to be constantly in the limelight through its nationalist posturing on JNU, protests in Kashmir, Pakistan-sponsored terrorism, beef ban, triple talaq and so on. Liberals often complain that the media is not adequately covering issues of public interest, that sections of the vernacular press are a lot more pro-establishment than their English counterparts and that the poor are being misled by the optimistic official narratives.
Those critical of the Modi government and its dominance of airwaves need no longer worry about the impact of skewed coverage. The poor, it turns out, have their own transcript of the news which is their lived experience since November 9. In fact the more the government?s spin is at variance with their own misery the more authority the PM and the NDA stand to lose. This is a possibility as the full measure of the suffering in rural India is yet to cascade to urban audiences. Farmers are unable to buy seeds
 to sow for the next season. The writer P. Sainath has said that besides farmers ?landless labourers, domestic servants, pensioners, petty traders? and many other groups have taken a terrible hit?. It is indeed bewildering to get a grip on the billions of transactions that have not happened across India in recent days. Harish Damodaran, an authoritative voice on rural India, has said that even if households find a way to cope, the cash crunch is bound to affect factories and farms. He writes
 that hardly a tenth of India?s workforce gets its salaries credited into bank accounts ? the rest get their wages in cash, either daily or weekly. If a substantial part of the 86% withdrawn currency is not replaced soon and if employers are unable to pay salaries for workers the former will have no choice but to shut down units or lay off workers. Likewise, farmers supplying milk to cooperative societies also get paid daily in cash, a practice that now stands disrupted.

Farmers, landless labourers, domestic servants, pensioners, petty traders, all these and many other groups have taken a terrible hit.? P. Sainath (@PSainath_org) November 16, 2016


The BJP assumes that satisfaction over the misery of the rich will be enough to secure support. It is betting against the depth of suffering now and the power of its recall value. There is no guarantee that citizens will make substantive gains once the process is complete. India will not become cash-rich like Saudi Arabia at the end of the demonetisation to buy off all its citizens with lavish benefits. Instead, what we are likely to see is an entire folklore emerge as to how the rich managed to get around demonetisation, through backdated invoices etc. Corruption and manipulation of the weak will not cease in 2017. For schadenfreude to be politically productive, it will need to translate into palpable suffering for the rich and indeed their naming, shaming and incarceration. We are unlikely to see any of that. Instead instances of writing off or adjusting the books for wilful defaulters will raise questions about the seriousness of NDA?s drive against the corrupt.
Meanwhile, the Opposition realises that the BJP?s monetisation scheme is politically monopolistic in intent as it wipes out the cash reserves of other parties. This is now a matter of their survival and that?s why they will try and present a robust counter-narrative, even if efforts to unite may be fruitless. The opposition will make the case that the BJP converted its own cash reserves before November 8 ? and point out (eventually) that the ruling party is outspending all rivals in the upcoming UP elections. These lines of criticism will resonate with those who suffer in the lines now and add to the existing disaffection brought on by BJP?s anti-Dalit, anti-Muslim reputation that has consolidated over the last couple of years thanks to incidents of flogging and deaths over beef possession.
This, then, is politically a moment fraught with great risk for the BJP. It is the first time that the people?s everyday experience is, in significant measure, in conflict with Delhi?s self-assured narrative. That is not a situation any government likes to be in.
The views expressed are personal.

Kolkata |?
People started queuing up outside banks as early as 6 am, as they anticipated a huge rush, as Monday was a government holiday. 
?I knew there would be rush after banks reopen on Tuesday and hence I?m standing in the queue since 7:30. You can?t depend on ATMs as they run out of money after some hours. But even thought I came early, 50 people had beat me to the queue,? said Ashish Poddar a school teacher of south Kolkata. 
Some in remote areas complained that the ATMs were not refilled since November 9 - one day after the demonetisation drive was announced by PM Modi. 
?The ATM of a private bank at Rangabelia in Gosaba (Sunderbans) didn?t reopen after November 9. We are left with no option but to rush to banks. There is a severe cash crunch. More than the crunch it is tension and panic that has gripped the villagers. They have once been cheated by the ponzi schemes and are now weary,? said Sudam Das a farmer of Gosaba in South 24 Parganas.
Guwahati |?Many traders and middlemen in Assam and other parts of Northeast have resorted to earning commission to exchange 500 and 1000 rupee notes with those of smaller denomination.
Local television channels showed several operators outside the Guwahati regional office of Reserve Bank of India exchanging  Rs 500 notes for Rs 200-300 and Rs 1000 note for around Rs 700-600.
There were reports of small traders in several villages in eastern Mizoram?s Khawbung in Champhai district resorting to using paper coupons to trade due to scarcity of currency notes of lower denominations. 
?The customers use the coupons to buy things from the same shop. This system may not be applicable to towns where it is difficult to recognise everyone. In villages everyone knows each other well and there is mutual trust,? the paper quoted a local official.
? Delhi-NCR?|?
People across Delhi-NCR queued up outside banks and ATMs from early morning to get their hands on some cash. The shutters of most ATMs were half-down until well past 8am, and security guards said the cash would not be available before 11 am. Since ATM withdrawal charges have been waived, people were seen rushing from one booth to the other. ?I?ve trying to withdraw cash from an ATM for three days, but there is always some problem. Since morning today, we?re being told that the server is down. Banks are not prepared to address the problems being faced by people,? said Tarun Sharma, standing outside an ATM in South Extension-I.

? Hyderabad | It?s a difficult business time for small-time restaurants and dhabas on the national highways.
Many passengers in the return journey from Vijayawada to Hyderabad in the night had to remain hungry as they had no change to buy even snacks and tea at a roadside restaurant near Suryapet. ?Our business has come down by 70%,? lamented Laxman, the supplier at the restaurant.
Though state-run road transport corporation buses are accepting the demonetised 500 and 1000-rupee notes, they are not returning change to the passengers.
Braving winter chill, long queues are witnessed at several banks and ATMs in Hyderabad since early Tuesday morning. ?We are hoping to draw Rs 100 notes at least today. Though the bank authorities gave us Rs 2,000 notes last week, we were not able to use them because nobody was giving us change,? Kishore Kumar, a software engineer said.

? Allahabad |?Six days after the decision to demonetise the 500 and 1000-rupee notes, only 20% of all the ATMs of Allahabad are functional.
Right since morning, as a result, people stood in long queues at ATMs and banks all over the city two hours before the bank opening time and in hope of the ATMs being refilled.
A cash-management official handling 200 odd ATMs of different banks in Allahabad, Pratapgarh and Kaushambi districts said that cash balance of only half of the ATMs have been taken out so far, and depositing it back in the base bank had become a tough task for their staff.
?The ATMs evacuated of old notes are still being loaded with 100, and the new 500 and 2000 notes, so the ATMs are not expected to function smoothly for one more week,? said Ashwini Tewari, a senior bank officer. 
According to Anand (Pappanji) Tandon, a businessman and state president of Vyapari Dena, the decision would yield good results in long term. But right now proper planning was required to deal with this crisis. ?The government should depute cash dispensing machines at hospitals and cremation ghats for people,? he said.

? Mumbai?|?In the city that never sleeps, some even came as early as 4 am to avoid the long queues before them outside various banks in the city. 
Long queues were seen in bank branches in Central Mumbai in parts of Parel, Dadar, Sion and Matunga, and in the Western suburbs in parts of Borivali.

?First two days people panicked, next two days they got angry and eventually they have got used to it,? said Altaf Ali who works at a hardware shop in Borivali. ?Our Prime Minister knows the pulse of people and hence knew people would adjust to it,? he added.
People started forming lines five hours before the stipulated start time of the banks.
Shambhoo Shrivats, a paanwala, slept next to the gate of a Borivali bank. ?I came at 4am and slept here to be first in the queue. Sleeping home or here is the same. My shop is just opposite the bank,? Shrivats said.

? Lucknow |?To avoid the post-bank-holiday rush, people in Lucknow started coming to the banks and ATMs since early Tuesday morning.
While some came earlier to check status of the opening of the cash dispensers, many had already fill up forms necessary for exchanging the old currency. 
?I hope my turn will come soon and I will not have to wait for long as my brother had to on Sunday. I need to buy medicines,? says Rakesh Kumar Sharma who had come to a bank in Gomti Nagar.
Bank branches in Chowk, Indira Nagar (A block, sector 14, 11 and 25), Vikas Nagar, had account holders coming in.

Transport and registry offices wore a deserted look after the demonetisation of 1,000 and 500-rupee banknotes.
Compared to civic bodies where people queuing up to pay utility bills and tax in scrapped currency, footfalls in the two departments have dropped by 60%. 
Collection of tax at the Ranchi district transport office, which used to be between Rs 25 and Rs 35 lakh ever day before the demonetisation of high-value currency, has dropped to less than Rs 12 lakh a day.
A bulk of the collections comes from the one-time tax from private vehicles, quarterly tax from commercial vehicles, registration and license fees. 
The one-time tax for private vehicles vary between Rs 10,000 and Rs 50,000, said a transport department official, who did not wish to be named. 
?Since banks are allowing withdrawals up to Rs 24,000 ever week, people who have to pay tax more than Rs 24,000 are not coming forward,? he said.
?Similarly, online payment has also dropped, as most people deposit online tax at Pragya Kendras or common service centres that are not accepting the scrapped 1,000 and 500-rupee banknotes.? 
District transport officer Nagendra Paswan said, collection of tax and registration fee has dropped by 50%, but the situation will take time to improve.? 
Daily collection at district transport office in Hazaribag has also dropped by more than 60%, said district transport officer Pranav Paul. ?Our collection has dropped from Rs 8-10 lakh to Rs 2-3 lakh a day. No revenue is coming in even from the check posts that collected Rs 15 lakh every day,? he said. 
The cash crunch is also pinching bus operators, as passenger boardings have gone down by 20%, said Krishna Mohan Singh of the Ranchi Bus Owners Association. 
?Occupancy in our buses has dropped by 50% after the announcement of demonetisation. The situation has partially improved now with cash flow. Despite that, there is drop by 20% in occupancy,? he said.
Not just transport department, registry offices too are feeling the pinch, said Ranchi additional registrar Rahul Choubey. ?Earlier, there was an average of 200 registrations of land and property every day, which has now dropped to 30-35. As a result, the daily collection has dropped by 70%.?  
The collection of civic bodies, however, has increased manifold due to demonetisation, as civic bodies are accepting the scrapped 1,000 and 500-rupee banknotes until November 24. The Ranchi Municipal Corporation has collected more than Rs 1.52 crore in the last one week against a monthly average collection of Rs 1.52 crore.

Since November-8 demonetization of old Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 currency notes, income tax (I-T) department?s crackdowns on black money hoarders in Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh have led to the unearthing of undeclared income of Rs 80 crore.
According to I-T principal director (investigation) of MP and Chhattisgarh RK Paliwal, as many as 84 search and survey actions and seizure of unaccounted cash through intercepts by police led to surrender of this huge undisclosed income in just over a month, which is equivalent to 35% of the Rs 229 crore surrendered during I-T department?s searches at 15 business establishments in both states between April 1 and November 7 this year.
Out of these 84 actions, eight matters of suspected money laundering (in Bhopal and Indore) were referred to the enforcement directorate for further action, added Paliwal.
A total of 11 business groups were searched after demonetization and it led to the seizure of Rs 1.78 crore cash in old and existing currency notes and jewellery worth Rs 51 lakh.
Besides, at least 49 business establishments were surveyed in different cities of the two states leading to seizure of undeclared income of Rs 52 crore. Those business establishments included 24 jewelry houses (eight each in Bhopal and Indore), nine builders and 16 other businesses, including caterers, private hospitals and even grocery traders.
The I-T department also seized Rs 9.39 crore, including Rs 2.17 crore in Rs 500 and Rs 2000 new currency notes after getting tip-offs from state police, special task force team and intelligence agencies through timely intercepts.
Meanwhile, a day-long I-T department?s search at the house and office of one private money lender, Anil Kumar Motwani, in Raipur on Thursday led to the surrender of undisclosed income of Rs 10 crore, besides the seizure of Rs 70 lakh, including Rs 43 lakh in Rs 500 and Rs 2000 new currency notes.  **************************************************




The International Monetary Fund said on Thursday it supports India?s efforts to fight corruption through the currency control measures announced this week, but stressed taking care to minimize disruptions in the economy.
Banks reopened on Thursday after a one-day break following the government?s decision to withdraw Rs 500 and Rs 1000 notes from circulation in a shock move designed to tackle widespread corruption and tax evasion.
?We support the measures to fight corruption and illicit financial flows in India,? IMF spokesperson Gerry Rice told reporters. 
?Of course given the large role of cash in everyday transactions in India?s economy, the currency transition will have to be managed prudently to minimize possible disruptions.?

Some banks in New Delhi had received the new Rs 2,000 bill and a number of ATMs were working again Thursday, two days after Prime Minister Narendra Modi?s big announcement.
Economists and some businesses, especially those involved in cashless payments, have welcomed the ?demonetisation? scheme as a vital step towards broadening the formal economy and improving tax compliance.
But it has disrupted the daily lives of hundreds of millions of Indians who live in the cash economy that is estimated to account for a fifth of India?s $2 trillion gross domestic product and who have low confidence in banks or plastic cards.

?The eradication of the black money menace from the Indian economy is a big positive in the long-term, and the Indian economy will be on a very strong footing once the short-term teething problems are done,? said Sachin Shah, fund manager at the Mumbai-based Emkay Global Financial Services.
Morgan Stanley hailed the demonetization as a ?bold move to curb black money? and bring millions more Indians into the tax regime. As of now, only about 1.6%?of India?s 1.25 billion people are paying income tax.
The surprise currency swap would ?have a debilitating impact on the parallel economy in the country,? said Harshavardhan Neotia, the head of the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry, referring to business conducted using illicit cash. **************************************************


The government?s decision to scrap high-value banknotes is going as per plan and will stamp out illegal incomes from the economy, Union minister Piyush Goyal said on Saturday during the second session of the Hindustan Times Leadership Summit.Here are the top 10 takeaways from the session:? Demonetisation is part of a series of efforts to curb black money and corruption, and make a difference to the mindset of people and businesses. There will be short-term pain of about 50 days but the people of India have shown tremendous support? Don?t understand how some economists have said that demonetization will hurt the economy. If you?re moving a part of the informal economy to formal, it will only add to the GDP. If people have postponed spending, it will be made up in the next two or three will quarters. Rabi (winter crop) sowing is up 8.5-9%? Auto industry numbers are down but if the government has been able to stop people from buying vehicles in cash, it should be welcomed. The government should be able to track every such transaction, otherwise terrorist activities, petty or serious crimes can never be traced? This is a responsive government that adapts to change. The administration didn?t have enough time to prepare for some logistical issues to keep demonetization a secret. This government knows how to keep a secret.? From the countryside, people are taking pain on the chin and are delighted with the demonetization move. This is often not reported. ? Only people with illegitimate wealth will worry, for the first time the honest people are feeling there?s a premium on their honesty. The mindset had become ?chalta hai? but ? but India loves disruptive change when it?s better for the country.? The BJP will sweep the upcoming elections, will win two-thirds support in Uttar Pradesh. The enthusiasm among the people in a state that elected the prime minister is unparalleled. In Punjab, the Akali-BJP combine will win.? Political parties should be funded liberally. At the end of day, good governance for political parties is good for India. Replacing bad money with good money is good for India.? There are times in history when one has to take bold decisions that have a long-lasting impact on economy and the way people conduct business. Demonetisation is one decision to change the way people think and work, it makes the honest feel respected for the first time. This decision will change the course of the economy.? Expanding renewable energy is an article of faith with the Modi government. But looking at the ?polluter pays? principle, it is the larger responsibility of the developed world to support India?s renewable energy thrust. We hope the West will come up to their promises. So far their effort has been terrible.For live updates from HTLS 2016, click here. **************************************************


The debate on demonetization may rock both Houses of Parliament on Thursday.
In Rajya Sabha, finance minister Arun Jaitley will reply to the Opposition?s charges against the government over the decision to scrap the high denomination bank notes.
In Lok Sabha, Congress vice president, a vocal critic of the note ban, will participate in the discussions and is expected to take potshots at Prime Minister Narendra Modi on how the decision has led to plight of the common people.
It will also be interesting to watch how the Opposition evolves its strategy after Jaitley?s speech. A section of the Opposition is demanding a Joint Parliamentary Committee?a panel with members from both Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha?to probe if the BJP knew in advance the government?s plan to scrap two bank notes and related issues.
?Let us see, how the Centre reacts to our demand. We will decide our future course of action thereafter,? said CPI(M) leader Sitaram Yechury.
Outside Parliament, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal and her West Bengal counterpart Mamata Banerjee will hold a joint rally in Azadpur sabzi mandi, one of the key areas worst hit by the demonetization. The leaders will address the concerns of the traders but also attack the Narendra Modi government.
On Wednesday, the Opposition had accused the government for plunging the nation in economic anarchy. They also accused that the Centre had leaked the information about demonetization to some of its corporate friends. 
Even as the government has listed two bills in Rajya Sabha, the centre may face difficult time to pass them.  **************************************************

The impact is such that the turnout of audience in cinema theatres here and in other parts of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh has fallen drastically.
?There are no collections (at the box office). Money is not in circulation. Telugu cinema industry is also hit hard like some other sectors, because middle classes are the main consumers of cinema,? Tammareddi Bharadwaja, a prominent filmmaker and a leading industry voice, said on Wednesday.

The makers of some small-budget films have postponed their release in view of the prevailing situation and notable among them is comedy hero Allari Naresh-starrer Intlo Deyyam - Nakem Bhayam, he said.
It may take a month for things to settle down vis-a-vis Telugu film industry, he said.



He also said it is unlikely that the actors would seek lesser pay owing to the government?s demonetisation move.
Top stars may not reduce their remuneration as is being predicted by some, he said.
?Nobody will reduce. They may not do films for some days,? he said.

Replying to a query, he said the presence of black money in the Telugu film industry is understood to be less. Those making films to bring their black money into circulation do not make it with the motive of revenue, he said.
The films made by such people may not even see the light of the day as they make films only to bring their money into circulation, Bharadwaja said.
If the system of taxation changes, people may not seek to evade taxes, he added. **************************************************


Late-night drama gripped West Bengal on Thursday after chief minister Mamata Banerjee decided not to go home and instead stay put at the state secretariat Nabanna to protest against the ?sudden deployment? of the army in the area.A livid Mamata took to Twitter to express her disgust, saying, ?Very unfortunate. Army stationed in front of Nabanno, the Bengal State Secretariat in a high security zone, in spite of police objection. I am waiting here at the Secretariat and watching to guard our democracy.?As the news hit headlines across TV channels and social media, the army stuck to its stand that it was a ?routine exercise? and refused to budge. Jawans could be seen noting down numbers of goods vehicles crossing Vidyasagar Setu, a stone?s throw from the state secretariat in Howrah district. The bridge connects Kolkata and Howrah across the river Hooghly. Soldiers were also spotted at Dankuni toll plaza in Hooghly district, and Pallsit toll plaza in Burdwan district.Addressing a hurriedly called press conference at Nabanna a little earlier, Mamata said, ?We knew the country is undergoing an economic emergency unleashed by demonetisation. But now the states are being hounded by the Centre for not falling in line. Today it?s Bengal, tomorrow it may be Bihar or Uttar Pradesh. Even if the army is used to suppress communal tension or riots, the states are not being informed. Why was the state not informed in this instance??Army spokesperson SS Birdi told HT, ?This is a routine exercise and we have already informed the police and the district magistrates. This was basically done to know the number of load carriers available that might be of use to the army in times of emergency.?Howrah police officers, however, claimed that the army had not informed them about either the deployment or the survey. **************************************************




The withdrawal of Rs500 and Rs1,000 notes is all set to impact the realty sector. While the builders who are already hassled by the slowdown rued that it will make the situation worse, there are indications that realty prices may reduce. 
Builders who used to take 20-40 % of money in black in many transactions and even the investors who parked their undisclosed amount will now shy away from the market. 
According to a leading builder who refused to be quoted, the move will hit them severely. ?Many of the homebuyers preferred to pay in cash to save taxes, which ranges up to 15%. In addition, there are many suppliers for whom we need to make payments in cash only. Their payment will be a headache now,? said the builder. 
The ready reckoner (RR) are the assessment values of the property, which play an important role in determining the stamp Duty and registration fees. In most places, the gap between the RR and the market value is in the range of 10 to 40 %. Builders used to take cheque of the amount calculated in RR and the remaining gap amount in cash.
Gera Developments, a leading builder said it will hit the cash market severely. ?The impact of this will be huge in many markets where payment of cash is mandatory and the major form of profit taking. These markets will see a major crash making an already difficult situation even more challenging. Rohit Gera, Managing Director, Gera Developments 
For years, real estate was infamous for parking unaccounted money and builders also preferred to take money in cash.
Many experts have called this a welcome step which will bring about transparency in the realty sector. According to Anuj Puri, Chairman & Country Head, JLL India, a leading real estate consultancy firm, banning of higher currency notes is a major move which will help curb unaccounted-for cash in the real estate sector. ?The effects will be far-reaching and immediate, and shake up the sector in no uncertain way. Stricter measures against black money have for long been required to help bring about greater transparency, give the Indian real estate sector more credibility and make it more attractive for foreign investors,? said Puri.

Residents are suffering most due to the demonetization of ?1,000 and ?500 notes as commercial establishments stopped accepting notes of the two denominations. Traders said their business was hit due to the move.
Notices stating that the ?1,000 and ?500 notes will not be accepted have been put up at grocery stores, fruit and vegetable vends, kiosks selling cigarettes and liquor vends across the city. 
Ramesh Gupta, a trader in Mamura, said, ?We are not accepting ?500 and ?1,000 notes. I refused to sell grocery to over half the customers who came in between 8am and 2pm. I am supplying items on credit to my regular customers.?
Eateries also refused to serve food to the customers paying in the two denominations.
Shiv Chauhan of Essen Foods, a multi-cuisine restaurant in Sector 66, said, ?We are sorry. We are not accepting ?500 and ?1,000 notes.? 
Liquor vends selling Indian made foreign liquor (IMFL) registered a 70%-80% dip in sales on Wednesday. ?We accepted higher denomination notes on Tuesday night even after PM?s announcement. However, we are not accepting these notes anymore. The number of customers fell by more than half that on a regular day. Many went back empty-handed as we refused to accept notes of higher denominations,? Kuldeep Singh, a vendor at Sector 22, said. 
Those working for daily wages, such as masons, carpenters, painters and loaders, are suffering due to the move. 
Mohd Hanif, a ?beldar? (helper) at Labour Chowk, Sector 58, said he and eight of his co-workers refused an assignment at an under-construction building as the contractor was paying them in ?500 notes. ?Though the wages of a beldar are ?350 per day, the contractor gives the amount collectively to one of us. We returned without any work for the day,? he said.
Those committing traffic violations had a harrowing time as the Noida traffic police also stopped accepting the higher denomination notes.
Prabal Pratap Singh, the superintendent of police (Traffic), Gautam Budh Nagar, said, ?We are only accepting notes of ?100 or lesser denomination against fines. Those who are unable to pay on the spot may retrieve their documents later from the court.?
Jewellers said their business was the worst hit due to lack of ?100 currency notes in circulation.
?Jewellery is costly and we heavily relied on ?1,000 and ?500 notes. There were no customers today. We hope that the market recovers in two-three days and buyers return. We will review the situation if it (poor sales) continues. There was never such a dip, even during the hike in rates of gold and silver,? SK Jain, district president, UP Udyog Vyapar Mandal, said.
Residents said that the move could have been timed better. ?This is an industrial city with lakhs employed in factories. Their pay day is on the seventh of every month. Those who had withdrawn money from ATMs have ?500 and ?1,000 notes. Most of them are unable to buy anything as the notes were taken out of circulation from the evening of the eighth,? Raj Kumar, a grocer at Khora, said. 
While there is optimism that the situation is a temporary one, traders are expecting a chaotic situation in getting the notes replaced. 
Subodh Mittal, a trader at Sector 12 market, said,?Life will be hard till all the ?500 and ?1,000 notes are taken out of circulation and are replaced by new currency notes. Very few will opt for ?2,000 notes as it will not be easily for petty traders to return the change. That means the government will have to pump in at least thrice the existing number of ?500 notes that were in circulation to strike a balance.?

(helper) at Labour Chowk, Sector 58, said he and eight of his co-workers refused an assignment at an under-construction building as the contractor was paying them in ?500 notes. ?Though the wages of a beldar are ?350 per day, the contractor gives the amount collectively to one of us. We returned without any work for the day,? he said.
Those committing traffic violations had a harrowing time as the Noida traffic police also stopped accepting the higher denomination notes.
Prabal Pratap Singh, the superintendent of police (Traffic), Gautam Budh Nagar, said, ?We are only accepting notes of ?100 or lesser denomination against fines. Those who are unable to pay on the spot may retrieve their documents later from the court.?
Jewellers said their business was the worst hit due to lack of ?100 currency notes in circulation.
?Jewellery is costly and we heavily relied on ?1,000 and ?500 notes. There were no customers today. We hope that the market recovers in two-three days and buyers return. We will review the situation if it (poor sales) continues. There was never such a dip, even during the hike in rates of gold and silver,? SK Jain, district president, UP Udyog Vyapar Mandal, said.
Residents said that the move could have been timed better. ?This is an industrial city with lakhs employed in factories. Their pay day is on the seventh of every month. Those who had withdrawn money from ATMs have ?500 and ?1,000 notes. Most of them are unable to buy anything as the notes were taken out of circulation from the evening of the eighth,? Raj Kumar, a grocer at Khora, said. 
While there is optimism that the situation is a temporary one, traders are expecting a chaotic situation in getting the notes replaced. 
Subodh Mittal, a trader at Sector 12 market, said,?Life will be hard till all the ?500 and ?1,000 notes are taken out of circulation and are replaced by new currency notes. Very few will opt for ?2,000 notes as it will not be easily for petty traders to return the change. That means the government will have to pump in at least thrice the existing number of ?500 notes that were in circulation to strike a balance.?

The Reserve Bank of India may have increased the ATM withdrawal limit to Rs 4,500 but almost half of the machines are still running dry as cash is in short supply, bank officials and unions have said. Cities such as Delhi and Mumbai, however, have fared better because of the greater focus on replenishing the ATMs. The central bank announced the increase in withdrawal limit on December 30, the last day for depositing the scrapped Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes. It was also the day the government was to revisit the cash restrictions announced with the November 8 demonetisation decision. ?The large number of ATMs which are idle today will start functioning once more 500 rupee notes come into the market. But, it will take some time,? State Bank of India group chief economist Soumya Kanti Ghosh told HT. The scrapping of the two high-value bills sucked out 86% of the currency in circulation, leading to a cash crunch that forced millions of Indians to queue up for hours outside banks and ATMs. Though the queues have shortened but cash crunch is far from over. While Rs 15 lakh crore worth of currency was taken out of circulation, only Rs 6.5 lakh crore has been put back in the system. All the 220,000 ATMs in the country have been recalibrated to dispense the new Rs 2,000 and Rs 500 notes introduced after demonetisation, cash supply still remains a concern. The government has come under fire from the Opposition for note ban and the cash chaos. Addressing the nation on the New Year?s Eve, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said focus of the government would be to bring banking operations back to normal. ?Most of the ATMs are still not working. The ATMs need to work through the day. Till that happens there is no meaning of these announcements, the moot point is the supply of cash and that needs to be worked on,? CH Venkatachalam, general secretary, All India Bank Employees? Association, told HT.The shortage of cash is more acute in rural areas which have a limited number of bank branches and ATMs. The focus was on supplying cash to areas where people were largely dependent on cash and electronic transactions were yet to pick up, bank officials said.According to a State Bank of India report, it will only be by January-end that 75% of the value of the scrapped currency would be back in the system. ATMs located in ?busy areas? such as shopping centres, offices or rail and metro stations were being given priority. ?We have identified some areas for ATM replenishment... banks are first trying to fill up ATMs with very high footfall,? an executive with a private bank said on condition of anonymity.  **************************************************




The BJP on Friday faced embarrassing questions when the Opposition latched on to a news channel?s ?revelation? late on Thursday that it had bought large parcels of land in Bihar ahead of demonetisation move on November 8.
?Fully prepared for demonetization?, tweeted Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi, referring to the news about BJP?s land deals ( Office of RG ?@OfficeOfRG Fully prepared for demonetization!), implying the BJP had prior knowledge of the note ban.
The JD (U), a constituent of the ruling grand alliance, was even more scathing. 
On a day when JD(U) president and Bihar CM Nitish Kumar reiterated his unequivocal support to demonetisation by calling it ?a big step against black money?, JD (U) spokesperson Niraj Kumar held a press conference to target the BJP on its land deals.
?The BJP got registered parcels of land in 25 districts of Bihar between August 20 and November 4 this year. In this manner, the party invested a huge sum of black money in land ahead of the demonetisation move,? Kumar said.

The JD (U) spokesperson went on to identify BJP Digha (Patna) MLA Sanjeev Chaurasia, state vice-president Lal Babu Prasad and state treasurer Dilip Jaiswal as some of the signatories to the land deals. He also wanted the party to come clean on where it had sourced the funds for the deals from. 
RJD spokesperson Mritunjay Tiwari insisted cash down payments were made in many of the BJP land deals. ?We have said all along that the BJP knew in advance about demonetisation and invested its black money in land.?

However, senior BJP leader and former deputy chief minister Sushil Modi said the allegation was outcome of ?somebody?s flight of imagination?. Modi said for over a year the BJP was in the process of buying land for its state headquarters in Patna and for offices in each of the party?s 45 organisational districts in Bihar. ?This has nothing to do with demonetisation?, he insisted.
The Congress accused the PM of ?selective leakage? of the demonetisation move to his own party people. ?This shows who the real supporters of black money are,? senior Congress leader Mallikarjun Kharge told reporters.
Congress? chief spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala alleged that ?documents prove? that BJP leaders bought the land just before demonetisation. ?Modiji?s mask of fighting black money is off. ? Surjewala said. **************************************************


Chief minister Devendra Fadnavis kicked up a new controversy by calling those opposing the Centre?s demonetization policy ?anti-national?.
Addressing an election rally at Ratnagiri in coastal Maharashtra, Fadnavis on Sunday said, ?All of us must stand behind Modiji in this 50-day long battle against black money?.Those who don?t support this are anti-national.?
The main opposition party, Congress, criticised Fadnavis over his remarks and demanded the state election commission take action against him for showing disrespect to democracy.
?People criticizing Modi are termed anti-national for the past two years, since the change of guard at the Centre. How can alking in favour of those dying in queues outside banks, talking about the enormous loss of manpower and losses suffered by the poor be anti-national? Why should there be an objection to criticism of failed governance and decisions taken without proper homework? The election commission should take action against the CM,? said party spokesperson Sachin Sawant.
Leader of opposition in the state Assembly and Congress leader Radhakrishna Vikhe Patil demanded an offence of murder under section 302 of Indian Penal Code be registered against the government for deaths caused owing to demonetisation. ?While in the Opposition, Fadnavis had demanded an FIR against the then government for farmer suicides. Going by the same logic, his government should now be booked for the deaths in bank queues,? he said. **************************************************


The demonetisation of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 currency notes caused losses to businesses ranging from a grocery store dealing in few thousands rupees to a car company with turnover in crores. However, for some establishments the cash crunch had resulted in increased customers and profits.Departmental storesSeveral departmental stores in Delhi said that their business had increased after demonetization as the customers wanted to pay through credit or debit cards - a facility that the neighbourhood kirana stores did not have. A shopkeeper at Gourmet Fresco in Defence Colony market said, ?We now get several customers from the neighbouring Kotla area also as most of the shops there do not have swipe card facilities.? The shopkeeper at Radha Krishna Store, a departmental store in Central Delhi?s Bengali Market said the only thing that has changed after demonetization is that while 80% of payments were earlier in cash, the equation has now reversed. The owner of a  departmental store in Khan Market said that they now get customers even from areas like Safdarjung and Lajpat Nagar. ?For us it is a win-win situation as we are earning more than we did earlier,? he said. Similarly, the owner of Soni Super Market in New Ashok Nagar said that since there are very few stores that have card facilities in the area, his shop?s sales haver gone up three times.Aadhaar Enrolment CentresAadhaar Cards are made by Enrolment Centres under the guidance and rules laid by Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI). Most enrolment centres in Delhi said that the demand has doubled since the demonetization was announced. Ashish Vijay, a resident of Sarita Vihar, who runs one such enrolment centre said, ?I recently had a camp in Saket where more than 250 people participated. Earlier, such camps saw not more than 150 people. Jitender, a resident of Mandawli, who runs an enrolment centre said, ?Earlier, we had to request people for space to set up a camp but now the RWAs are calling us to set up counters.? This is primarily because people think that it will soon be mandatory for people to link with bank accounts with Aadhaar, he added.Point of Sale (POS) or swipe machinesMost banks said that there has been an overwhelming demand for POS machines. A POS machine, loosely referred as a swipe machine, is used to make card payments and is installed in shops by private vendors in partnership with banks. Banks make an estimate of the sales and set the limit to which cash could be swiped. Banks also monitor the transactions. A banker with the Indian Bank in East Delhi said that since demonetisation he had received requests from 20 businessmen for the machines  ? far more that the requests received over six months. A State Bank of India official said that earlier the bank had to request businessmen to take swipe machines but now traders make repeated calls for the machine as the bank is struggling to meet the surge in demand.Read more Safal and Mother Dairy outletsThe government?s rule that old ?500 and ?1,000 notes could be used at Mother Dairy and Safal stores increase the footfall at these shops. A Safal outlet owner in Defence Colony said that sales reached up to ?2.5 lakh on some days after demonetization. ?We sold goods for around ?30,000 on an average but for at least five days after demonetization was announced, the sales touched more than one lakh figure. Several goods were over and more than 50 people were in queue on some days.? Another Safal shop owner in Mayur Vihar said his sales had increased more than thrice and people who never came to his shop were now visiting.Petrol stationsPetrol stations became the most sought after place as the government allowed banned currency here till December 2. A petrol station owner in Safdarjung said that for a week after December 8 ? the day when demonetization was announced ? the sales were at least three times more but people mostly paid in old currency. Another owner in Mayur Vihar said that though the station earned more than twice for a week after demonetization the business had seen a decline since December 2. **************************************************


Currency printing presses are running at ?full capacity? to sustain demand for new notes, RBI said on Saturday, while asking people to switch to other modes of payment such as debit and credit cards to reduce strain on bank branches.
Adequate stock of all currency notes has been kept ready at more than 4,000 locations across the country, and bank branches are linked to them for sourcing their requirements, RBI said.
?To sustain the demand, Printing Presses are printing the currency notes at full capacity so that adequate quantum of notes is available,? the central bank said in a statement.
RBI said the scrapping of Rs 500/1,000 notes cast a huge responsibility on the banking system to ?swiftly withdraw? the currency in a smooth and non-disruptive way and to provide new notes of other denominations.
It also entailed swift withdrawal of the scrapped notes from ATMs within a few hours of the announcement made on evening of November 8 by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
RBI further said it also involved recalibrating ATMs for issuance of other legal tender notes and reloading them in a matter of two days and providing the exchange facility, just after a day from the announcement.
?While these efforts are afoot, public are encouraged to switch over to alternative modes of payment, such as pre-paid cards, Rupay/Credit/Debit cards, mobile banking, internet banking. All those for whom banking accounts under Jan Dhan Yojana are opened and cards are issued are urged to put them to use,? RBI said.
Such usage, RBI added, will ?alleviate the pressure? on physical currency and also enhance the experience of living in the digital world.
On November 10, about 10 crore exchange transactions have been reported. Further, banks and RBI are kept open on Saturday and Sunday to meet the urgent requirements of public and to ease the situation.
The scheme for exchange of the specified bank notes for other denominations is available all across the country till December 30, 2016 and even beyond, at specified RBI offices.
RBI appealed that as there is ample time for people to exchange old notes and there is no need put ?avoidable strain? on bank branches.
RBI also said a detailed reporting system for banks has been put in place. It further said that with a view to preventing misuse of the exchange facility, the authorities are ?closely monitoring the information received through the reports about exchange and deposits?.  **************************************************


At a time when the local traders at tourist sites are crying foul over the impact of demonetization on their business, a press release issued by the ministry of tourism on Thursday has claimed that currency ban has had little impact on inflow of tourists in MP.
The release also said currency ban has not affected foreign tourists? arrival or for that matter foreign exchange earnings in the country. 
The report shows figures to corroborate the claim. According to the release, there has been a remarkable rise in sale of e-tickets in the last two months. ?A total of 9131 foreigners visited various sites of Madhya Pradesh in October while in November, 12,445 foreigners visited MP. However, this is the usual trend every year,? said Zulfiqar Ali, superintending archaeologist, ASI, Bhopal.
Sudesh Tamrakar, senior tourist adviser said, ?Local tourist inflow has reduced but the number of foreigners visiting the tourist sites remains the same. Overall, the difference is insignificant.?
Madhur Sharma, a tourist operator, however tells otherwise. ?The tourist guides who are not registered with state government, used to have an easy time drawing Rs 100-1000 from a tourist. But after note ban, most of them are struggling to manage routine expenses.?
Alka Kushwaha, a local artifact vendor at Mandu says, ?This is the best time of the year after monsoon season when people prefer coming to Mandu. I see no difference in number of people visiting but this year, they are hesitant in spending on luxury items.? 
?Archeological Survey of India has smoothly transitioned to cashless mode of payment by simplifying the process of e-ticketing. But the government cares little for local artisans and businessmen. They are finding it hard to make ends meet,? said Vikram Manwani, business middleman at Chanderi. 
Besides the heritage sites, Madhya Pradesh is also known for religious tourism. When a local vendor in Ujjain, Mahesh Tiwari, was asked about the impact of cash ban on his business, he said, ?We suffered huge losses in the past month. Now, most of us sell ?pooja parcels (basket consisting all necessary items for performing pooja in a temple)? starting from Rs 500. We have also bought swipe machine so that a customer does not return empty-handed?.
Raghu Ram, a bag-seller in Panchmarchi, had to ask to his helper to leave because he was unable to pay him wages. ?Kishan was working with me for the past six years and was not ready to leave but I was unable to pay him,? Ram said. **************************************************


In a harsh criticism of Prime Minister Narendra Modi over demonetisation, AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi on Monday called him ?a tyrant? who has caused havoc in every house to satisfy his ego.Owaisi said the revolution which Modi was dreaming to bring about with the November 8 demonetization would never come as it had pushed people into distress.Stating that in one stroke the Prime Minister virtually destroyed the livelihood of the poor and deprived sections, the MP said he should remember that those standing in queues at banks and ATMs today will stand in queues on the polling day to vote him out.?You are in power today but tomorrow you will not be there. Many Prime Ministers came and left. You will also go,? Owaisi told a public meeting here.Thousands attended the meeting at the All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) headquarters to mark ?Milad-un-Nabi?. The meeting, which began Sunday night, continued till the early hours of Monday.Speaking in Urdu and liberally using Hyderabadi idioms, Owaisi ridiculed Modi for stating that he was a ?fakir?. ?Will a fakir wear Rs 15 lakh suit? What kind of fakir you are who wears new clothes and new shawl with new style every day, who wants to inconvenience the poor for 50 days and who is not worried over the loss of 120 lives. You are not fakir, you are zalim (tyrant),? thundered Owaisi.Owaisi said it would take one year and not 50 days for the post-note ban situation to return to normal. He pointed out that economic experts have projected a loss of three percent GDP or Rs 4 lakh crore due to demonetization.Stating that Rs.12.5 lakh crore in Rs 1,000 and Rs 500 denomination notes were deposited in banks till November 30, he asked if this was black money.He said Modi caused distress to every family at a time when there were good rains after two years and the marriage season had just started.He claimed that Rs 3.5 lakh crore were deposited in bank accounts between September 15 and 30 while the average deposits for the two weeks was Rs 1.5 lakh crore. ?Whose money is this?? he asked.The MP said Modi failed on all fronts including his promise to control price rise and bring back black money to the country in 100 days. ?He sometimes laughs, sometimes cries. He doesn?t know what he is doing. He says there is threat to his life. We only pray that he live for 150 years,? the AIMIM chief said.Owaisi said the crisis offer an opportunity to Muslims to show their Islamic character and help the poor and the needy.He urged people to ensure that no one in their neighborhood, irrespective of his religion or caste, goes hungry. He said while everybody was facing great difficulty, it was the duty of Muslims to have empathy towards fellow human beings and share with them whatever little they have. **************************************************


The Reserve Bank of India?s latest restriction on deposits over Rs 5,000 in old currency notes has saddled bankers with more work, apart from also having to face irate customers asking them for explanations as to why they couldn?t come earlier.The new norms which came into force on December 20, stipulate that deposits above Rs 5,000 in value will require explanation and customers are subject to questioning. Such deposits can also be made only once per account, until December 30, the deadline for the demonetisation exercise to end.Bank officials say this has increased their work with more time now needed for each customer and has delayed servicing thus leading to longer queues and public outrage.?The constantly changing rules are difficult to process in our core banking system as it requires making changes across all branches. It is a huge loss of business and time for us,? said a senior executive with a private bank. ?Customers have also postponed high-priced purchases waiting for this uncertainty to end,? he added.The biggest negative is the fact that depositors will now also have to explain to at least two bank officials why they couldn?t deposit earlier. ?Tenders of SBNs (specified bank notes of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000) in excess of Rs 5,000 into a bank account will be received for credit only once during the remaining period till December 30, 2016?The credit in such cases shall be afforded only after questioning (the) tenderer, on record, in the presence of at least two officials of the bank, as to why this could not be deposited earlier and receiving a satisfactory explanation,? the RBI circular said.A branch official at a State Bank of India branch in Mumbai said, ?It is difficult to judge a ?satisfactory explanation?. Customers give reasons such as waiting for queues to reduce, being out of town or not being well. We cannot harass them as there is no requirement of proof for their explanations.?Since November 8 when Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced demonetization, rules on deposits and withdrawals have been changed frequently, sometimes as often as on alternate days making it difficult for both banks and customers to cope with an ever changing landscape.A senior large public sector bank official said, ?We have to go through the pain as we are dictated by the government and the customers. We are becoming the pawns between them and have no option but to bear the brunt on both sides.?A customer at a bank in Borivali, Mumbai said, ?I have been waiting for the queues to subside. Also, didn?t the government tell us to not rush to branches as there is time till December 30? This is unfair.? **************************************************


Chief minister Akhilesh Yadav distributed financial assistance to 13 families whose members had died in queues at banks and ATMs across Uttar Pradesh. ?These people had gone to take out their own money and lost their lives after having failed to get it ,? said Yadav at a programme. Yadav also gave financial assistance to Sarvesh Devi, who gave birth to a child while standing in a bank queue in Kanpur Dehat early this month. On Saturday, she came to collect the cheque with her baby ?Khajanchi?, who was named so for being born at a bank. Although the chief minister also distributed financial assistance of Rs 25 lakh each to families of an Indian army soldier and three policemen of central para military forces (CPMF) killed on duty, the focus of his address remained demonetization. While an assistance of Rs 5 lakh was given to the family of Razia who had burnt herself in Aligarh ,all other were given a sum of Rs 2 lakh each. The chief minister spoke to the members of each family and asked them about experiences they had while standing in a bank queue. He targeted Prime Minister Narendra Modi for demonetization and said, ?Those who had promised ?achchhe din? are now raising the people?s hopes by asking them to go cashless. Going cashless is a bigger dream than the dream people saw about the achchhe din. If a government becomes a cause of people?s miseries, it gets voted out in elections. Many states are going to poll in coming days and the people will give the BJP a befitting reply,? said Yadav. Yadav said demonetization would lead to job cuts and have an adverse impact on the economy. ?We also want end of black money and corruption. But the labourers are coming backs from Ghaziabad and other places to their villages. Companies are discussing plans to cut salaries of workers,? said Yadav.?Initially there was a feeling that demonetization will lead to a great change. There were articles in newspapers about the change. Now economists are saying that demonetization has badly hit the economy,? he said Raising questions about online security and risks involved in going cashless, Yadav quoted a youth caught for taking out money from others? bank accounts and said the youth confessed he was caught for being a novice.?We also distributed laptops. We will also distribute smart phones too. The Samajwadi Party government has given a message of making UP a digital state,? he said. **************************************************


People can deposit as much cash as they want in banks to get new notes but shouldn?t take it as an amnesty scheme for undisclosed income, finance minister Arun Jaitley warned on Wednesday following a government withdrawal of high-value banknotes.
Speaking to public broadcaster Doordarshan, Jaitley said the law will take its course if the deposited cash is found illegal but assured families and ordinary citizens that they didn?t have anything to worry about.
?Black money isn?t anyone?s basic right,? Jaitley said.

The minister?s comments came a day after the government put out of circulation notes of denomination Rs 1,000 and Rs 500 in a dramatic bid to stamp out corruption and drain illicit cash from the economy.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi had earlier appealed to people to disclose their unaccounted money till September 30 but had also indicated strong steps to unearth black money if people don?t comply. ?don?t blame me for any harsh steps,? Modi had said on his radio show, Mann ki baat.
The finance minister assured the ordinary citizen and said the ?bold? move will free India of corruption and boost the economy.

?Families shouldn?t worry. They should go and deposit their money in the bank. Maybe there will some issues in the first few weeks but everything will be smooth after that,? he said.
The government?s move has sparked panic across the nation with widespread confusion and long queues at banks and automatic teller machines till late on Tuesday. Under the new currency regime, ATMs will start dispensing new Rs 500 and Rs 2,000 notes from Thursday and people can deposit the older Rs 1,000 and Rs 500 notes in the bank.
Jaitley praised the scheme, saying the currency shake-up will weed out corruption, banking deposits will rise and have a positive impact on tax collection.

?Every state will benefit from the state. When countries develop, cash shrinks and digital modes of transactions expand. It?s good that India is going in this direction.?
Jaitley also said electioneering ? a sector where large sums of cash often allegedly fund political parties -- will become more clean.
?Political funding will become visible and legitimate. It is a bold step to change the nature of the nation.? **************************************************


An unintended impact of the demonetization plan has been people who want dowry are at their wits end.
Among those affected is a certain Gupta from Bihar where dowry is a common practice. He had asked for Rs 20 lakh in cash as dowry from the bride?s parents for his son?s marriage.
But the demonetization has vapourised that demand.
?I had hardly asked for anything, but now even that we can?t take? this goes against our culture where the bride?s parents contribute? We will have to forego that amount for now,? he said.
But others such as Raman Prasad, a resident of Ranchi, Jharkhand, have found a way out. He will take the dowry in kind: a car, electronics and down payment for a flat in Noida, where his son stays.
?Who is going to risk accepting cash, now? It is the bride?s parents? problem how they will arrange for the money to purchase these things,? said Prasad.
Demonetization may be a blessing in disguise for parents of brides.
?With demonetization, you get the unaccounted cash out of the system. That will reduce pressure of the bride?s families. The cost of the wedding will also come down as dowries will come down... Avenues of spending are shrinking, and no matter how you go about it, there will be a negative impact on dowry,? said Amit Nandkeolyar, assistant professor of organizational behaviour at Indian School of Business.
Another family in Mumbai, which had taken Rs 15 lakh as gift, returned the money to the bride?s parents.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi had in public rallies sought time till December 30 to fix the pain being experienced across the country following his demonetisation move.?If you find anything wrong with my intentions or actions, hang me in public. I promise you I will give you the India which you desired. If someone faces problem, I also feel the pain. I understand their problem but this is only for 50 days,? Modi had said in rallies in Gujarat and Goa, referring to the long queues at ATMs and the acute scarcity of cash in cities and towns.With the deadline set by the PM having expired, HT revisited persons and places we had serialised earlier ? from Budgam in Kashmir to Guruvayoor in Kerala ? to do a reality check on whether Modi has delivered on his pledge to ease the situation for his countrymen. The feedback was mixed:Satleja, Sunderbans A mother of two, Pampa Mistry is much happier now.

Lanura, KashmirUnlike the rest of the country, the Valley never witnessed queues outside ATMs. Locals attributed the phenomenon to months of unrest that left people impoverished.

Queues at banks and ATM kiosks are shrinking and digital payment modes are spreading, but the 50 days of pain from the shock recall of two high-value banknotes is set to linger into the new year, experts warned on Wednesday.Prime Minister Narendra Modi, after announcing the demonetisation drive on November 8, had cautioned that people would face temporary hardship and sought their cooperation: ?...help me for 50 days and I will give you the India you desired.?But don?t expect to wake up on Thursday, the 51st day of the announcement, for the situation to be back to pre-demonetisation times, said experts and bank officials.?Though the situation has improved, the cash crunch will continue for some more time ... it is expected to normalise in the second half of January,? said Soumya Kanti Ghosh, the chief economic adviser of the State Bank of India.Even then, the normality is expected to return incrementally as limits on cash withdrawal could continue till banks are comfortable with lifting the restrictions.Read |?Note ban not enough: Corruption in India is like water, it finds a wayThe government promised to restore normality by December 30, when a deadline to deposit defunct notes expires. But uncertainty and confusion continues even 50 days after 500- and 1,000-rupee notes were scrapped in an attempt to curb tax evasion and counterfeiting.The drive enjoyed popular support at first but public patience wore thin as the continuing cash crunch forced millions to queue at banks and ATMs for hours to draw money. Sources said only about 60% of the more than 200,000 ATMs in the country were working as of Wednesday.Bankers expect chaos in the coming payday as well because of shortage of new notes. Of the 560 million people working in factories in India, a mere 10% is in the organised sector, where salaries are transferred electronically into bank accounts.Cash withdrawal limits have not been raised or withdrawn.

Nobel laureate Amartya Sen said on Friday the decision to demonetise currency was taken hurriedly without thinking about its consequences.?I don?t think that this (demonetisation) decision was taken after considering all sides.

The bigger the deposits in banks since the demonetisation drive, the earlier you will get a notice from the income tax department.Officials said accounts in which deposits of Rs 2 lakh and more were made since November 8 are under scrutiny. Rs 7 lakh crore was deposited in more than 60 lakh such accounts since the government banned high-value banknotes, they added. The department suspects a part of the illicit cash in circulation before the government banned high-value banknotes may have come back into the banking system through such big deposits.While investigations into individual cases may take more than a year, all notices are expected to be sent out by March 31, the officials added.Transactions in bank accounts that remained dormant till November or new ones are also being monitored and banks have been asked to send reports on these.Read |?Note ban not enough: Corruption in India is like water, it finds a wayAfter the initial round of examination based on data analytics and response of the account holders under the scanner, the department will send specific notices, a senior government official told Hindustan Times.?The IT department has huge data?we will use data analytics to segregate genuine and non-genuine cases?though the deposit amount will matter while sending notices, it will also largely depend on the other parameters,? the official said.The IT department has already sent out over 5,000 notices.?We can also assure people that we will not blindly send notices as that would lead to harassment but people with discrepancy in their incomes and deposits need to worry,? the official added.

Prime Minister Modi?s call for a ?celebration of integrity? through a sudden demonetization of Rs. 500 and Rs.1000 currency notes, much like his earlier schemes like the Jan Dhan Yojana, is yet another ?jumla?. But if the opening of millions of ?zero balance? bank accounts under the Jan Dhan Yojana was a harmless gimmick, the ill-conceived monetary experiment this time may actually end up inflicting some costs on the public.
The temporary proscription of currency notes of higher denomination is supposedly aimed at rendering the presently held stocks of black money and counterfeit currency worthless. What is noteworthy is that it neither makes any difference to the generation of black money through myriad channels, nor does it touch that part of the stock of black money held in other forms of assets like benami properties in land and real estate, gold, foreign currency, offshore bank accounts, etc.
Nobody knows how much of illicit wealth in the country is stashed in wads of Rs. 500 and Rs.1000 currency notes. One can only guess that it would be the petty brokers, wheeler-dealers and thieves who store their ill-gotten wealth in that fashion, besides mainstream political parties and politicians like the ones seen in the Tehelka or Narada tapes. The big fish have long devised much more sophisticated ways of stashing or laundering their money. Hence the current demonetization is unlikely to touch anything more than a miniscule fraction of the present stock of black money in India.
To the extent it will succeed, the stocks of illicit wealth are likely to be only destroyed but not unearthed or confiscated, nor the illegalities punished. Given such uncertain and measly benefits, the costs of demonetization are significant.
First, a disruptive shock has already been delivered to the cash-transactions based economy, which has particularly affected the lives of the rural and urban poor, who eke out a living in the vast informal economy, besides inconveniencing a significant section of the middle classes who are yet to get included in the world of cashless transactions. The impact of this is certainly short-term and transitory, but whether this shock was necessary at all is questionable, given the elusive benefits. 
Second, the move may just end up increasing the proportion of other assets like benami property, gold, dollars etc. in which black money is held and diversify the market for money laundering instruments, making it even more difficult to detect. Third, given the fact that new Rs. 500 and Rs.2000 currency notes will now be introduced to replace the proscribed currencies, the RBI will have to incur significant costs of printing a very large volume of currency notes. Moreover, if high denomination currencies are really the problem, why replace the Rs. 1000 denomination with Rs. 2000, which will make it even easier to build fresh stocks of black money?
There is no guarantee that the high denomination currency notes won?t be faked again, given that the agency and technology of counterfeit Indian currency notes remain unearthed. As for the contribution of this move to combating terrorism, it is a red herring. The role of opaque instruments like Participatory Notes, used by FIIs operating in the Indian stock market, are more relevant for financing terrorism than Indian currency notes of high denomination.
The real problems ailing the Indian economy lie elsewhere. The amount of stressed loans in the Indian banking system has crossed a whopping Rs. 9 lakh crore, a bulk of which is owed by domestic corporates to the public sector banks, causing a huge debt overhang. Despite doubtful claims of fast economic growth, revenue mobilisation has not shown any signs of improvement and consequently, redistributive policies have been rolled back. 
Under the Modi regime, substantive measures to promote investments, economic growth, revenues and welfare expenditure have been supplanted by gimmicks, PR spins and a brazen pursuit of select corporate interests. The latest instance of a conflict of interest lies in today?s full page newspaper advertisements by an online payment service provider congratulating the Prime Minister for the demonetization announcement.

?Every citizen can join this mahayajna against the ills of corruption, black money and fake notes... Let us ignore the temporary hardship.?It is now 48 days since Prime Minister Narendra Modi made that appeal, as he scrapped 86% of India?s bank note--by value--in circulation. Initially, millions of Indians queuing up to withdraw their own money from bank accounts did indeed ignore the hardship of lost wages and stress of the queue. The common refrain: It?s worth it because the rich with black money will suffer. As it becomes increasingly evident that only those in the queue are suffering, as are livelihoods, the lines are as long as ever and people have died waiting for money, there is a distinct change in mood. Over the last week, there have been attacks on banks in Uttarakhand, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, and roads have been blocked by frustrated mobs in UP. Images of hundreds pressing against a bank entrance?s steel grill, narrowed to allow one person to enter, appear to have become the leitmotif of the era of notebandi, the colloquial term for Modi?s grand experiment. The patience displayed in the queue has given way to jokes, frustration and abuse and eroded the government?s credibility.Government spokespersons insist there is no shortage of money. They may not be entirely wrong. Every day, India is witness to law-enforcement agencies seizing bundles of the distinctive, pink bundles of Rs 2,000-denomination bank notes. Those in queue ask the obvious question: We stand here for days to get a few thousands, how do they get lakhs and crores?The short answer is corruption, the very thing notebandi is supposed to strike at. A vast money laundering exercise in India?s unseen financial netherworld appears to have been largely successful, as the anticipated return of almost all the money that was taken out of the banking system indicates (The government thought Rs 2.5 lakh crore or so in unaccounted money would not return). Some of those with unaccounted or ?black? money did get their comeuppance, but those numbers are likely to be far smaller than anticipated. How could this happen? It could happen because Indians are masters of subversion and because notebandi was a shot in the dark, with no precise target or preparation to overcome this culture of subversion. So, corrupt bank officers colluded easily with corrupt seekers of pink notes. Thus far, about 50 bank officials from private and public banks and the Reserve Bank of India have been found conspiring with money launderers--many more have got away. Bundles of pink notes continue to turn up in cars, homes, offices and bank lockers. Bear in mind that these instances only relate to cash. Thousands of crores of unaccounted rupees were converted to real estate, gold and luxury items, from watches to handbags. Modi has either not understood the reach of corruption into India?s administrative system and collective soul or he did understand but was convinced by his circle of trusted bureaucrats that a series of administrative fiats ? surgical strikes, to use popular government nomenclature ? without adequate planing could, somehow, bring about the new normal that he seeks. Read: Demonetisation just a ?pseudo war? against corruption, says Yogendra YadavCorruption in India is like water ? it finds a way. It is marked by ingenuity, determination and perseverance, qualities that could transform India if deployed for honest means. The most ingenious method recently evident: Thousands of poor Indians with basic bank accounts persuaded ? for a fee, obviously ? to rent their accounts to launder old bank notes into new. It isn?t politically correct to say this, but the majority in India is dishonest, either by circumstance, culture, upbringing or habit. I would like to believe many can be turned if circumstances change, but that may be optimistic, given the casual and widespread disregard of laws in every sphere of life, most visible in the form of the roadside havaldar who waits for a Rs-50 bribe from the streams of vehicles that run red lights. Corruption in India can only be curbed through carrots, sticks, meticulous planning and sustained effort. Incentives are important; so is stronger punishment. As former chief economic adviser Kaushik Basu has argued, it may make sense to decriminalise the giving of bribes. Read: Note ban not a surgical strike on corruption, it?s firebombing on poor: RahulHowever, most important is administrative and political reform. In 2007, the second Administrative Reforms Commission made 18 recommendations to enforce ethics in political and legislative functions. All 18 were rejected. Politicians have consistently closed ranks over political reform, and Modi has stayed within those ranks. Indeed, in the budget session of Parliament earlier this year, his government tweaked foreign contribution laws to allow political parties to receive foreign donations retrospectively, from 2010. As soon as this amendment passed, the Congress and BJP, held guilty by the Delhi High Court of accepting foreign donations illegally, withdrew their appeal from the Supreme Court. Yet, Modi said last week that his party had not altered even ?a comma or a full stop? in the law that regulated political funding. Some honesty would be in order.Many commentators have also pointed out how political parties need not account for donations below Rs 20,000. It is no surprise that in 2014-15 six leading political parties received 60% of their funding from ?unknown? sources, and the BJP received the most such funding with Rs 977 crore over two years. The systemic eradication of corruption also requires reconstructing an administrative system largely unchanged since colonial rule. Modi began well: Some old laws were scrapped and business requirements eased. But the bureaucracy and its rusting frame still remains India?s backbone and the tentacles of the inspector raj are as tightly wound around the economy as ever. We have also seen the right-to-information system eroded, no Lokpal--whatever its infirmities--is in evidence, and, now, the efforts to find notebandi?s laundered money portend a greater bureaucratic invasion of our lives, which Modi had once promised to reverse (remember ?minimum governance??).  Without a carefully planned, wide-ranging ? and honest ? war of reform against politics and the bureaucracy, no isolated surgical strike can survive its overstated claims.Views expressed are personal.  **************************************************




More than 75 business outlets located on either side of the Indo-Nepal border remained closed for the ninth consecutive day on Thursday following the sudden decision of the Indian government to demonetise high value currency notes of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 denominations as part of a drive to fight black money.
Hundreds of people, along with a good number of Nepali citizens, queued up before Indian banks and ATMs located on the border.
Manoj Lakhotia, 39, owner of Vaishnavi Traders located on the main road in Raxaul, said: ?We downed our shutters after customers stopped visiting out outlets since Rs 500 and Rs 1000 notes were scrapped. I am totally dependent on customers from Nepal for business.?

Pawan Shahzada, a teacher in a government school at Semera in Nepal, is a shattered man. ?I saved Rs 2 lakh of Rs 500 and Rs 1000 notes of India to get my wife treated at AIIMS in Delhi, but PM Narendra?s Modi?s sudden and abrupt decision has pushed me back by many years,? he lamented.
Incidentally, the Indian currency notes of Rs 500 and Rs 1000 denominations were banned in Nepal several years ago fearing proliferation of a huge quantity of fake notes in Nepali territory. The ban was subsequently lifted.
?We reposed our faith in the Indian currency again and the ban was lifted. But now I feel robbed now,? he said.
Following demonetisation in India, Nepal?s central bank instructed all Nepali banking and financial institution as well as Nepal Rashstra Bank to stop transaction of these two high values notes of India. Shahzada has been queuing up before India banks to exchange his amount in the name of his relatives. ?So far I have been able to exchange only Rs 20,000 but now they have begun marking our fingers with indelible ink, what should I do now?? a desperate Shahzada asked.

The situation has given rise to middlemen too.
Anil Sinha, a social worker at Raxaul, said: ?Nepalis and Indians are getting their notes exchanged after paying huge commissions to middlemen. Almost all markets of Raxaul and Birgunj, which depend largely on Indian rupees, wore a deserted look as no customers were there.?
Dr Ajay Kumar, posted in a Nepali health centre, said: ?People hired a middleman to get notes exchanged in India on commission basis, but he informed all of us after two days that all the notes were seized by police on the border.?
Raju Agarwal, a cloth merchant in Birgunj and also an officebearer of the Birgunj Commerce and Industries Association, said businessmen were having to pay their staff salary despite the fact their shops are closed. He, however, said a few Indian customers had started visiting the markets on the Nepal side from Thursday.
Bordering Nepal is largely dependent on Indian currency for trade and social responsibility. Dhruv Prasad Gupta, a businessman in Raxaul, said normalcy would return once new Rs 500 notes are circulated in these localities.
Threat for exchange

Central Bank of India?s regional manager Harishanker Thakur said they were facing threats from local people and traders for exchange of the banned notes. He said one of the senior managers of the bank in Raxaul had been threatened that he would be eliminated after he refused to exchange Rs 2 lakh of a local trader. A case has been filed against the businessman with Raxaul police station.

Civic agencies are recording a demonetisation windfall as people are taking advantage of schemes to clear longstanding tax dues with abolished 500- and 1,000-rupee notes.
But experts believe the returns don?t reflect improved efficiency in tax collection.
Figures provided by 47 urban local bodies to the Union urban development ministry show their tax collection increased by 268% in November 2016 compared to the same period last year.
These municipalities collected Rs 3,607 crore last November. But the corresponding figure till November 22 this year is Rs 13,192 crore already.
A majority of this tax has been collected after November 8, the day Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced scrapping of the high-value notes. The collection figures for the preceding months were far less.
Mumbai municipality?s tax collection has been Rs 11,913 crore this month, which way better than the Rs 3,185 crore it collected last November. Surat?s municipal revenue increased from a mere Rs 7.19 crore to Rs 100 crore.
The fantastic returns could be attributed state governments? special schemes for taxpayers to pay their dues ? some of which are said to have been unsettled for years ? with the demonetised notes.
?This is the positive effect of demonetisation. People are clearing up their old dues, paying with Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes. For the urban local bodies, it has meant substantial mopping up of tax collection,? urban development minister M Venkaiah Naidu said.
But expert Srikanth Viswanathan, the CEO of advocacy group Janagraaha, called the increase in municipal revenue a reflection of people using up their defunct notes, rather than an indication of improved tax efficiency. 
?The municipalities? own revenues continue to be in the range of 1-1.5%, far less than in countries such as Brazil and South Africa. But the increase does reflect the huge potential from such revenues once the entire property tax administration is overhauled across urban local bodies,? he said.
Viswanathan said municipalities could transform the system by levying property tax on rational market-oriented base capital values, ensure a good tax assessment register and significantly improve their collection efficiency through spatial analytics and outsourcing.
