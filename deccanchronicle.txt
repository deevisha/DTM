
Chennai: People in Chennai were seen queued up in large numbers outside the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to exchange Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 currency notes after Prime Minister Narendra Modi said they were just paper with no value. The move has changed the lives of people in ways one cannot imagine and has even put weddings on hold.
A Chennai man, who wanted the bank to grant him over Rs 4,000 for his friend's daughter's wedding, was denied the amount by the concerned authority. He had even carried the wedding card as proof but to no avail.
Nirmal Kumar's friend's daughter marriage is planned for Friday morning and reception was scheduled for Thursday evening. He came to exchange the old 500 and 1000 rupees note in the Chennai office of the Reserve Bank of India.
Because of the unexpected announcement by government, the family was in a state of panic as to how to exchange their money to be able to conduct their daughter's marriage.
So now friends of the family and relatives are helping by giving them the correct currency.
"My friend's daughter is going to get married tomorrow and her reception is scheduled to take place this evening. We came to the Reserve Bank of India to exchange notes, but only got Rs.4000. Even though I demanded more money by showing them the marriage invitation, they refused to give it. We demand that the government reconsider the decision and favour at least the needy," Nirmal Kumar said.
"This is just going to be a big problem for people," said a middle-aged man waiting in front of an ATM in Chennai to withdraw money.
The residents had mixed reactions to the unexpected announcement by Prime Minister Narendra Modi that Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 currency notes will cease to be legal tender from midnight Tuesday, with most calling it a "big problem" for the common man.

New Delhi: Amid growing protest by opposition against demonetization, Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar on Saturday again voiced support to the Modi government's decision, saying it is a positive step which will lead to benefits.
"This 'notebandi' is a positive step which will lead to benefits. It will happen," he said addressing a JD(U) meeting, where differences in the party came in the open as former party chief Sharad Yadav targeted the Modi dispensation over demonetization.
Terming corruption and black money as a big sin and a "festering wound" which must be eradicated, Kumar said, "Severe steps will have to be taken. That is why we offered our support to this (demonetization). It is a positive beginning."
The JD(U) president also refrained from any criticism on the implementation issue, which has been vociferously raised by the opposition.
He, however, added that demonetization alone will not end lack money.
He asked Prime Minister Narendra Modi to also launch a crackdown on benami properties immediately and target black money hoarded in assets like gold and diamonds.
"Currency forms a significant part of black money but total black money is much more than that. The country's money has been laundered to overseas as well and that too should be brought back," he said.
Kumar's remarks in support of demonetization, which has united most of the opposition parties against it, came after Yadav hit out at Modi dispensation over the issue.
Yadav alleged the decision is aimed at capitalising banks that were "sinking" due to Rs 8.5 lakh crore of NPA and its goal is not to target black money.
The decision has forced entire country to stand in queue, said Yadav, who played an active role in rallying opposition's protests before Kumar declared his support to demonetization.
He, however, also spoke in the same vein that his party supports the step but is critical of the ill-prepared manner in which it was executed.
Kumar, however, did not touch on the implementation part of demonetization, merely saying that his government does everything with due preparation and so should the Centre.
"We support demonetization. It should be implemented with preparation. We do our work with full preparation. They (Centre) should also have done that.
"We said there can be nothing better if it helps curb corruption, bring out some amount of black money and illegal work is stopped to some extent," he said.

We are now well into the third week of yet another “surgical strike” (as described by BJP chief Amit Shah) by the Prime Minister’s magic wand attempt to cleanse the national economy of “black money” by demonetising two high-value currency notes. But by demonetising the Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes, the government sucked out almost 87 per cent of the money in the market. When Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced this demonetisation to rid the nation of “black money” — which really means income and financial transactions that didn’t realise for the state its rightful share of taxes — the entire nation welcomed it. The other reasons the government gave for this is that it wanted to purge the system of counterfeit notes and break the terror finance network. With the benefit of cold hindsight, and with the comfort of not having to go against the now clearly-waning popular sentiment for demonetisation, it’s evident the government was clearly unprepared to embark on such a major “reform”. The nation has now witnessed the breakdown of the financial system and the severe pain it has inflicted on the hundreds of millions who sustain themselves as daily wage earners, small retailers of perishable goods and farmers who have to invest now to sow fresh crops and reap harvests of foodgrains and fruits and vegetables.
The nation has thus belaboured the Prime Minister severely, and the PM, proud of his broad chest, has been reduced to tears at least twice in the past fortnight. What went wrong? The first is very obvious. It should have had enough of the new currency notes for transfusion to replace the withdrawn lifeblood. It also didn’t build up meaningful stocks of the existing `100 and smaller denomination notes to make everyday transactions possible without much dislocation. That was not the case. It is now clear that the RBI will take many months just to replace the high-value notes. Till then the anemia will persist. There is bound to be economic costs for this prolonged anemia. On Thursday, former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, less of a politician and more of a top-notch economist, estimated the consequential contraction of GDP to be around two per cent. Recently, I was in a discussion with several senior economists and the most conservative estimate was a drop in GDP by at least 2.2 per cent. That kind of sudden contraction, at about the halfway point of the financial year, will mean that the immediate contraction is going to be much more painful.
Consider this. Almost 40 per cent of the GDP is in cash transactions. As much as 31 per cent of adults do not have bank accounts. The Jan Dhan drive has indeed substantially added to the number of bank accounts. But nearly half of the additional bank accounts are “zero balance” accounts. Creative optical solutions being this government’s forte, all these accounts have now been credited with `1 each to take them out of this column. With this looming contraction in the immediate future, one would not be surprised if the government will once again resort to creative optical solutions by “improving” national income accounting by putting new values to unrecorded production and services. For instance, by re-estimating the value of chappals made by village cobblers or the value addition of panwallahs. But then don’t compare it with earlier growth rates. The last such tweak gave this government an additional 2.2 per cent GDP boost, but was misused by it to suggest the train was moving faster.
Now look at the scale of damage caused. India has a workforce of close to 450 million. Of these, only seven per cent are in the organised sector. Out of this 31 million, about 24 million are employed by the state or state-owned enterprises, the rest being in private sector employment. Of this vast reservoir of over 415 million employed in the unorganised sector, about half are engaged in the farm sector, another 10 per cent each in construction, small-scale manufacture and retail. These are mostly daily wage workers and mostly earning less than the officially-decreed minimum wages. Thus, a good part of this so-called “black money” which the government has choked off — held in `500 and `1,000 notes — is actually money in flow. What the government is seeking to unearth is a smaller part of the money in stock, which is held by business people, politicians and bureaucrats. But in its professed anxiety to unearth this, the government has effectively thrown out the baby with the bathwater. The economy may not have ground to a complete halt, but in hundreds of million homes the cooking fires are not being lit. This is because most daily-wage earners are not getting paid in full or even in part. And even if they are paid with the old notes, and even if they can enter banks, where are the smaller notes or even new notes for the banks to exchange them with?
The amount of “black money” held as cash is only about five per cent of the total tax evaded income. The rest is held in cash abroad, land and property, and jewellery and gold. Unearthing this will take some doing and in doing so officialdom and its political masters will only generate more “black money”. And consider this: as much as 55 per cent of FDI investment coming in (about $44 billon last year) is actually Indian-owned money round tripping its way back from the economy it fled from. Is the government now going to look at this gift horse in the mouth by asking these ECBs to declare their origins? So after not anticipating the scope of the economic devastation visiting the nation, Mr Modi has taken a new tack. He is now hollering that he is fighting for the vast mass of the poor who have been looted all these decades by the upper classes.
He has thus demonised the upper classes and has fired the starting gun for class warfare that would have made Lenin and Mao proud. He has even started saying startling things like “meri jaan ko khatra hai” due to his newly-donned mantle of the class warrior. His claim of death threats to him supposedly due to this has generated much consequential mirth in the social media, with a play on the word “jaan”. Till now Mr Modi has been largely immune from this. He enjoyed huge support, even without the bot armies and professional social media manipulators, while he has also been hugely vilified. But, of late, he has become a cause of mirth. With that he has entered politically dangerous waters. Will Mr Modi now retrace his steps somewhat and extend the deadline for the exchange of high-value notes? Will he now order the massive buildup of Rs 100 and smaller notes to relieve the monetary anemia? This will no doubt mean some loss of face. But that is still better than loss of head.

The Indian society right now is very much a cash society.  USAID did a study which reveals that 77 percent of respondents received income in cash and 79 percent made savings in cash and 90 per cent who used debit cards, used them only to withdraw money from ATMs. RNCOS business consultancy services research paper, titled Indian prepaid card Market Outlook to 2017, says 97 percent of retail transactions are done with cash.  World Bank Global Findex database says only 11 percent of consumers used debit card for purchases. RBI says the number of non-cash transactions per inhabitant per year is 6.7 in India. Only 6 percent of the merchants accept digital payments.
There were only 14.61 lakh point of sale (POS) machines in the country as on December 11 2016 as per RBI records.The number of POS machines per million is 693, the lowest in the world, according to Ernst & Young; 70 percent of these POS machines and 75 percent of the transaction happen in 15 cities. There are 1.5 crore retail outlets and 94 percent of them operate in less than 500 square feet of built up area. This shows we are so dependent on currency and that the infrastructure required for a shift to plastic money is simply missing.
Credit vs debit cards: Total number of debit cards: 71.25 crore. Total number of credit cards: 2.64 crore
RBI came up with a concept paper in March 2016, which makes public and official the inadequate card acceptance network in the country. Says the RBI concept paper: "From the above, it can be noted that while there has been a significant growth in number of cards, the growth of infrastructure has been lower both numerically and in terms of geographic spread and this has impacted the card usage". Hence the government urging people to use cards after withdrawing currency is effectively driving people away from the 1.4 crore retail outlets to the less than 10 lakh stores, which have POS machines.
RBI has also listed seven possible reasons for the poor growth in card acceptance infrastructure. The high capital cost of POS machine, recurring maintenance / servicing cost, difficulty of servicing POS machines in rural areas, low footfall of cards in rural areas forcing acquiring bank to withdraw services, lack of telecommunication infrastructure, lack of incentives, merchant discount rates, awareness level of consumers and concerns about the security of using this facility are all cited as major constraints in our journey to a less-cash society.
Transactions (Credit, Debit cards): Total Number of transactions: 97,18,68,686. ATM: 75,73,85,390. Point of Sale: 21,44,83,296
RBI had suggested two approaches to improve the card acceptance infrastructure- mandating banks to install terminals in some proportion to the number of cards they have issued and setting up of Acceptance Development Fund to subsidize the cost of acceptance infrastructure. As per World Bank, though 53 percent of adults in India have bank accounts a mere 15 per cent of adults reported using an account to make or receive payments. World Bank estimates that there are 33 crore internet users in India and that mobile subscriptions went up from 23 crore to 96 crore between 2007 and 2015. As per Airtel CEO Gopal Vittal, smart phone penetration is 39 percent with 60-70 percent having data connection. These connectivity details showing a fairly good growth pattern are insufficient to shift to a cashless economy.
 
Government record on managing  infra
At the slightest provocation or anticipated provocation, the government blocks the existing infrastructure to the public.  During the unrest following the killing of Hizibul Mujahideen militant Burhan Wani, mobile internet was suspended in Kashmir for straight 133 days. Internet access on prepaid mobile connections continues to be suspended. During the Jat quota agitation in February, Haryana Government suspended the internet for 10 days in several districts. In the last 3 years there were 39 forced internet blackouts across 12 states for almost 250 days. 
When the government urges all of us to shift and depend on this infrastructure alone for all our transactions they are urging us to be in a state where those in power can switch on or off our lives at will. Whether a government will do it is a question but whether we should leave the government with such an option is another. The policy framework also needs to ensure interconnection and consumer protection. Today the payments regulator, the RBI, prevents a Paytm customer from paying a Mobikwik customer. If RBI does not trust these players then how would a customer trust them?
Transacted amount: Total amount transacted: Rs 2,64,080 crore. ATM: Rs 2,19,962 crore. Point of Sale: 44,118 crore
Will demonetization help move to a cashless economy?
Lack of currency notes might force people to shift to plastic money. Of course, there is a huge business opportunity out there and they are on an all-out campaign as if going digital is the end of black money. The gadgets, the POS machine manufacturers, the payment intermediaries - together is a business worth lakhs of crores. Demonetisation offers  a great realisation too. If money which is current cash could be demonetized at one stroke, what about the money in accounts? Accounts are just a promise or a claim on money. The lack of currency notes might force people to opt for plastic money. But if this was the intention of demonetization, as is being stated now, then this government and the Prime Minister should be feared. They are not democratic, to say the least.
Restricting  options and suffocating those who are already starving for fresh air to drive them to a cashless economy is authoritative and should be defeated because of that alone.  If the state continues to push for a cashless society, then we should also look at technological ways of bypassing spying commercial banks acting as intermediaries. Crypto currencies such as Bitcoin could provide a counter-power to the hegemony of banks and intermediaries. Cash is in fact the only direct way we can hold government money. This is why people convert their commercial bank deposits into cash when they lose confidence in a bank, causing a bank run.
Does that mean only Cash?
This doesn't mean all transactions have to be in cash alone. We should leverage advantages that technology brings to us. But the choice of using cash or plastic money for a transaction should rest with the citizen.  It can take away larger denominators and make doing transactions of larger amount in cash extremely difficult. Maybe, even mandate that transactions beyond a certain amount should be done through accounts. But the move and advocacy for cashless society should be resisted at all cost because it costs us our freedom.

Thiruvananthapuram: The Aakhrosh Diwas call given by Opposition parties to protest against demonetisation on November 28, is likely to take the shape of hartal in Kerala. Opposition parties resolved to intensify the agitation against demonetisation in states where they have sizeable support. While the CPM and the LDF have not yet taken any decision on the form of protest on Monday, one can expect a strong protest in Kerala. A section of parties have also called for a Bharat bandh.

Kozhikode: The nationwide strike called by opposition parties on Monday against the demonetization drive by the Modi Government brought forth a range of benefits for the streets and the city at large. Although the public transport kept away from city roads, private vehicles took the opportunity for a free and easy ride through the city without traffic problems. All the banks were functioning but a few people were seen making various transactions.  Due to two continuous days of bank holidays on Saturday and Sunday, a majority of the ATMs were closed down due to scarcity of money.
Only those ATMs functioning near the main branches of various banks were stocked with money. Meanwhile,  the ‘Team Clean Beach’, an initiative started by morning walkers on Kozhikode beach spilled over to the streets with brooms and sticks and cleaned the city to make it beautiful for city folks coming the next day. “We try our best not to waste a hartal day sitting idle at home, instead our team gathers at the beach where we take our daily walks and clean it, making it free from plastic and paper waste”, said Arun Das, one of the members of Team clean beach.

The services of the Team clean beach were not limited to just cleaning the beach, the members also organized free bike services for the stranded passengers in Kozhikode railway station and bus stand. More than 30 members of the team were on the city roads offering their services. The situation was peaceful in Wayanad and Kasargod and isolated incidents of opposition party workers attempting to block private vehicles in party strongholds were reported from parts of Kasargod.

New Delhi: The Congress on Monday accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi of not following the law in issuance of Rs 2,000 currency notes and vowed to raise the matter inside and outside Parliament.
Claiming that the PM had plunged the country into "financial anarchy", senior Congress leader Anand Sharma said the introduction of Rs 2,000 denomination notes is an "illegal act" as the the notification required to be issued under the RBI Act for printing new currency has not been issued, ignoring what is mandatory under the law.
He also hit out at the Government's move to put indelible ink on the fingers of those exchanging notes.
A united opposition will raise this issue vociferously in Parliament besides making it a subject for mass movement, the Congress said.
The Deputy Leader of Congress in Rajya Sabha alleged that the Prime Minister is consciously deflecting attention from key issues and "fooling poor masses by masquerading as a crusader against black money under the garb of nationalism" and said those supporting PM "and his apologists are illiterate in Constitution and in law."
"The Prime Minister is squarely responsible for plunging the country into financial anarchy. There is an undeclared financial emergency without invoking the provisions of Article 360 of the Constitution.
"The Prime Minister's sensational and theatrical announcement of November 8 on demonetization had no legal sanctity as the monetary policy is the domain of the Reserve Bank of India," Sharma said.
The introduction of Rs 2,000 currency denomination is an illegal act, since under the RBI Act no notification has been issued, and such issuance is mandatory before the introduction of a new currency note, he said.
"Circulation of this illegal new currency of Rs 2000 denomination contradicts government's move to control black money circulation and is a continued illegality," Sharma told PTI.
The Congress leader accused the Prime Minister of making misleading statements and violating the law and the Constitution multiple times.
In a scathing attack on the government for its move to put ink on fingers of common people exchanging notes, he said, "Even dictators have not done what this government has done.
"Only the Nazis branded people. Our citizens and foreign guests are also being branded for withdrawing money. It is a matter of shame and concern.Incredible India has been overnight converted into Indelible India," he alleged.
Sharma said the replacements of old notes of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 denomination are not yet ready and this scarcity has put people to inconvenience.
"It is inflicting great suffering on the people, especially the poor, the farmers and the total workforce of 33 crore Indians in the unorganised sector and the farm labour," he said.
He accused the Prime Minister of having besmirched the image of India internationally as a rules based country.
Major opposition parties have already come together in Parliament to take on the Government on the demonetization decision and its implementation.
Sharma said neither the PM nor the Finance Minister have any legal sanction or authority to prevent and deny people access to their own bank accounts and impose limits on the withdrawal from savings accounts of households, citizens and salaried employees.
"The opposition is justified and firm in its demand for a JPC probe on the selective leakage of government's move. This leakage is a violation of the secrecy and directly helped hoarders of black money, aided the laundering of money abroad and also diversion of investments through bullion, stocks, bonds and securities.
"We are firm and determined to take this to a logical conclusion and to expose the intent and actions of this government," Sharma said.
The former Union minister said the demonetization move had affected employment in a big way.
"This money belongs to the people and you are now making them beg for their own money. This has never happened in any country," he said.

Thrissur: Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan has promised effective measures to protect construction sector and workers hit by the policies of Union government like demonetization.
Addressing a public meeting here on Sunday at the conclusion of the conference of the Trade Unions International of Building, Wood, Building Materials and Industries (UITBB), he said the regressive policies had created the crisis.
"In construction sector with 3.5 crore direct and 1.5 crore indirect workers has come to a standstill. The situation in Kerala is no better. There is difficulty in sourcing building materials, soil and granite,” he said.
He further said the Green Tribunal had come in the way of smooth functioning of the sector and Centre had failed to address the rise in prices of cement, steel and sand.
“Due to demonetization, several interstate workers have returned, and the BJP has even failed to take their trade union (BMS) into confidence,” he said.
He also said that as per the promise by Narendra Modi before elections, by now, his government should have given jobs to five crore people. But the total jobs created in the last two-and-a-half years are just 1.3 lakh.

Would you opt to temporarily freeze 85 per cent of your bodily functions merely in the hope that you will awake refreshed? Not likely, given the risks and the meagre reward. Shockingly, the Government of India chose to do just that on November 8, by delegalising notes of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000, which comprise 85 per cent of the Indian currency in circulation. If the government’s actual objective was to destroy black money, think again. A widely dispersed “new black money” machine has already mushroomed, exchanging the frozen Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes into new legal tender at a cost of between 20 to 40 per cent of their face value. Many people prefer this route rather than declare their hoarded stocks and lose 33 per cent to tax if the amount is the current year’s income, or 100 per cent as tax and penalty if it is undeclared income from previous years. But not all sellers are owners of undeclared wealth. Many are ordinary people who got caught short on cash and are desperate to buy things they need — medicines, food or pay for transport to get home. The banks are inaccessible for exchanging currency and ATMs are by and large not operative. This mess will take at least till the end of the year to be straightened out.
In the meantime, scores of small establishments and workers will accumulate debts to pay daily expenses while the economy accumulates the potential value lost in this period. The loss of individual credibility, savings and self-respect is far more permanent and difficult to tabulate. Who would oppose hunkering down systematically on black money? Prime Minister Narendra Modi has targeted election financing and corruption as the root of the black economy. But we are a long way from doing anything substantive. Even the accounts of political parties are not yet open to public scrutiny under the Right to Information Act. Without flushing out the pipes, just flailing about at the symptoms cannot drain the swamp of black money. The declared objective is noble. But did we choose the optimum implementation mechanism? What have we achieved by the secrecy; the haste and the resulting action without adequate preparation? Why not, instead, have given adequate notice of the government’s intention to crack down, specifying a future date? The efficacy of the step would not have been diluted. If anything, it would have been enhanced. Brandishing a big stick is better than using it.
A notice period would have allowed better logistics to be in place — sufficient new notes; working ATMs and mobile exchange units for the unbanked. Ordinary people could have been educated and prepared for accessing the new currency. There was nothing to stop the tax authorities and the police from clamping down, during the notice period, on the activities of potential black money aggregators to dissuade leakages — just as they are doing today. But leakages are inevitable in any currency exchange programme. Around 53 per cent of our 400 million bank accounts are dormant. Many may be multiple or “benami” accounts of the same person. These accounts are viable vehicles to launder black money by paying the nominal holder of the account a small fee. The government says it will not scrutinise deposits up to Rs 2.5 lakhs in each account. But even an average deposit of Rs 40,000 in each of the 200 million dormant accounts can convert Rs 8 trillion of black money in old notes into temporarily white money, in new notes. Other avenues are for small businesses to deposit their old notes as an advance in the accounts of their suppliers.
Employers can similarly deposit advance salaries in the accounts of their employees. Thirty per cent of the Rs 14.5 trillion currency in the high denomination notes is held legitimately in banks and other government agencies as working capital. Another 30 per cent could be the legitimate savings in cash of around 170 million households, after excluding the poor households, and the cash working capital of the 10 million registered businesses in India. This leaves 40 per cent, or `6 trillion, as the potentially unaccounted wealth held as cash. But don’t hold your breath — it would be very surprising if the amount extinguished is more than just 15 per cent or `1 trillion. After all, the government’s tax amnesty scheme which closed in September 2016 required a sacrifice of 45 per cent of the amount as tax and penalty. It netted just `0.65 trillion in undeclared money. In the late 1970s, when gold was smuggled into India because legal import was prohibited, a small proportion was regularly and ritually “caught” and confiscated by the customs authorities — a “nazarana” for retaining the “izzat” of the “sarkar”.
Much the same may happen now. Around `1 trillion may fail to be deposited in the banks, enabling the government to declare victory, while individual hoarders of black money take a haircut. If the government can find a non-inflationary way of monetising this reduction in the liability side of the balance sheet of the Reserve Bank, it will be a double victory. It could use this extra liquidity in FY 2017-18 to boost the economy, which would still be reeling from the internal shock and disruption. Recapitalising public sector banks and waiving the debt burden of state governments can give decent economic returns if it kickstarts investment in projects or if it generates the necessary political capital to implement GST on schedule. Using some of this largesse to reduce the tax rate for low and middle income earners in FY 2017-18, particularly for senior citizens, may compensate them for the pain unnecessarily inflicted on them. Some significant salve is necessary to restore the credibility of the government as an efficient protector of the aam aadmi. The economic disruption, loss of income and possibly even the loss of jobs from a demand constrained economy will worsen the well-being of ordinary citizens. It would be unwise to sacrifice stability and sustained growth at the altar of high risk, quick payback, adventurist options. Why fix something which is not broken?

Maharajganj: Buoyed by BJP's win in civic elections and bypolls, party chief Amit Shah today said it showed people's support for Prime Minister's demonetization move and claimed some opposition leaders were upset as their money "looted" in scams has turned into trash.
"While opposition is organising Bharat bandh and Akrosh Divas...every where BJP posted unprecedented victory. People are with the government's decision on demonetization," he said at party's parivartan rally here, referring to victories in bypolls in Assam and Madhya Pradesh and civic polls in Maharashtra and Gujarat.
"Poor do not have black money...Rahul baba, Akhilesh babu, behen Mayawati...it is the one that was lying with you all that has been lost...what will happen now...those who are caught with black money will lose 50 per cent and this money will be put in the treasury of the country," Shah said at the election rally.
The polls result favouring BJP showed that people of the country support demonetisation, he said and promised that any ill-gotten money deposited in banks will go into government treasury so that it can be used for the welfare of the poor.
Stepping up attack on parties opposing demonetization, Shah said certain leaders were angry with demonetization as all the wealth accumulated by them is gone due to a single stroke of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
"SP, BSP, Congress, Mamata (Banerjee), (Arvind) Kejriwal are all angry with Narendra Modi today. Do you know why this is so...what was amassed through loot has been turned into 'raddi' (trash) by Modiji on November 8," he said
"Modiji has announced that those depositing large amounts in their accounts like Rs 5 crore or Rs 10 crore ... the looted money will be used for welfare of the poor," he said.
His remarks came in the wake of passage of a bill in Lok Sabha to amend Income Tax Act to impose tax on deposits made post-demonetization.
The Taxation Laws (Second Amendment) Bill, 2016, provides for paying 50 per cent tax on unaccounted deposits, or 85 per cent if caught. "For ten years those amassing trillions of rupees in their homes through scams are today angry with Modi," Shah alleged said.
"Till the morning of November 8, they all used to ask Modiji, what have you done against black money and today they are asking why have you done this," he said.
"The country is with Modiji... it is in favour of the decision of demonetization," he stressed.
Striking a dialogue with the audience, he asked whether they supported the decision of demonetization or 'bua-bhatija', a reference to BSP chief Mayawati and Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav.
Over the last few days, BJP won one Lok Sabha seat each in Assam and Madhya Pradesh besides bagging a number of assembly seats in Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat and Arunachal Pradesh.
The saffron party also emerged victorious in local bodies polls in Maharashtra and Gujarat. Shah alleged that fake notes had made their way into India during 10 years of UPA rule.
Hitting out at Congress vice president Rahul Gandhi for his 'khoon ki dalali' remark on surgical strikes across the LoC, Shah said Modi government took action within ten days of the Uri attack unlike the previous Congress-led government "but Congress shehzada (prince) says Modiji indulges in 'khoon ki dalali'".
"Rahul baba how will you know the value of army jawans' bravery...how will you know the value of their sacrifice...it is invaluable," he said, claiming that no one can dare touch the boundaries of the country under the BJP government.

New Delhi: S&P Global Ratings today said demonetisation and a likely GST rollout from September 2017 are likely to cast a "higher disruptive impact" on informal, rural, and cash-based segments of the economy. It further said corporates and banks are likely to face short-term downside risk as the demonetisation-induced cash crunch will curtail GDP growth.
"Indian government reforms will have long-term structural benefits, but carry short-term execution and adjustment risks," S&P Global Ratings Credit Analyst Abhishek Dangra said in an article titled India's Demonetization And the GST: Short-term Pain For Long-term Gain, published today.
The rating agency recently revised downwards its estimated economic growth rate for 2016-17 by one full percentage point to 6.9 per cent to reflect the disruption caused by the surprise move of demonetisation.
It said the government's decision to cancel the legal tender status of high-value rupee notes has caused a significant physical cash crunch. "Both demonetisation and a goods and services tax (GST, expected to be implemented by September 2017) are likely to have a higher disruptive impact on the informal, rural, and
cash-based segments of the economy," S&P said.
It said these reforms could benefit India in the long run after short-term pain. The credit and risk analysis firm believes that demonetisation and GST could result in a wider tax base and greater participation in the formal economy. This should benefit India's business climate and financial system in the long run.
"We believe such measures can promote greater economic flexibility, strengthen the business climate, funnel more wealth into the formal banking system, and help redress public finances over time," said Kyran Curry, also a credit analyst of S&P Global Ratings.
"We expect lower private consumption in fiscal 2017, but expect demand to revive and growth to rebound in fiscal 2018. India should shortly revert back to an 8 per cent annual growth trajectory," says Dharmakirti Joshi, Chief Economist of Crisil, a subsidiary of S&P Global. "In our base case, we expect a short-lived disruption with demand revival in the next one to two quarters, limiting the impact on Indian banks and corporates.
In the short term, however, the rural and informal sectors are experiencing large-scale adjustments. Business sectors that often transact in cash, including jewellery and real estate, will also face some degree of upheaval, S&P said.
"The banking sector will face marginally negative pressure in the short run as loan growth will remain soft, and asset quality and earnings will be pressurised at the margin.
Digital banking and higher banking base could benefit the banks in the long run," said another credit analyst of S&P Global Ratings, Geeta Chugh. In a less-likely downside scenario, the shock of demonetisation will not be absorbed within the next few months and the economic disruption will spill over into fiscal 2018,
and potentially coincide with the introduction of GST, the US-based agency said.
It added that in a less probable situation, economic growth will stay lower for longer, raising stress levels on corporates, banks, and other financial institutions; although the sovereign rating is likely to remain resilient.

Kochi: The much talked-about cashless economy may remain a pipe dream for most people dealing with the utility and other payments involving government departments and local bodies in Kerala. The E-payment system remains a totally alien concept for most local bodies including the city corporations such as Kochi, Kozhikode and Thiruvananthapuram. The E-payment system introduced by entities such as Kerala State Electricity Board (KSEB) and Kerala Water Authority (KWA) is yet to gain traction as majority of the people are still using hard cash route for making the utility payments. The penetration of the E-payment system is less than 15 per cent of the total of KSEB, says a spokesman.
"Though we introduced E-payment system two years back, it is yet gain popularity", he said. The currency crunch and the new-found thrust placed on cashless economy by the Union Government may help the system to be more popular. "The E-payment system of KSEB is user- friendly compared with that of the KWA", said Krishna Kumar, who shifted to E-payment mode two months ago.
The local bodies are the worst in terms of introducing E-payment despite the talk about the knowledge economy by all and sundry. Kochi corporation, known for flaunting its credentials as the fastest growing IT hub in the state, is yet to have a full-fledged E-payment facility.    
Although some modules of the long drawn E-governance have been implemented, the crucial components like property tax or professional tax payment are yet to be shifted to the e-payment system. Only services like registration of death, birth and marriage and public grievances can be availed online. The average daily tax collection of the corporation has plummeted to `10-12 lakh per day from `25 lakh per day following demonetization thanks to the non-existence of online payment facility.
In Kozhikode corporation, property taxes and a portion of the advertisement taxes were paid through e-payment, said officials. However, the majority still prefer to pay at the billing counters, they add. "In the last financial year, only 20 to 30 per cent of the users utilised the provision for e-payment", they said. Although officials said e-payment was user-friendly, some 'technical glitches' might be preventing the taxpayers from using it. The Thrissur corporation is not at all having a system in place for the public to pay taxes online. Deputy mayor Varghese Kandam told DC that the civic body would start receiving online payments within six months. "Once we implement the system, all payments could be made online from across the globe", he added.  
The average daily revenue collection of Thiruvananthapuram corporation has slipped to Rs 35-40 lakh from the levels of Rs 50-60 lakhs. The corporation official who spoke to this news paper was not sure whether the online payments had really increased after demonetisation. Normally, the average online transaction is just around 1,000 in a year. The ‘Sankhia’ software used by the local body for the e-payment is not user friendly, sources said.    The corporation is trying to strike a deal with State Bank of Travancore to get 10 or 15 swiping machines installed at its counters. The corporation draws most of its revenue from building tax and professional tax that show a clear surge between September and February.

New Delhi: Congress on Sunday made it clear it has not called for a 'Bharat bandh' on Monday, but will hold protests across the country against demonetisation, which it alleged "was a political move being sold as a fight against corruption".
Speaking to reporters in New Delhi, party leader Jairam Ramesh said Prime Minister Narendra Modi believes in "dhamaka" politics and the decision to scrap high-value currency notes was taken because he had seen the "writing on the wall" in Uttar Pradesh, where polls are due next year.
He claimed that Rs 1,000 and Rs 500 notes were scrapped to cover up the government's failure to deliver on the Prime Minister's big electoral promise of bringing back black money stashed abroad and Modi wanted to do something "dramatic".
"It is a political move which is being sold as a fight against corruption," Ramesh said hitting out at the Centre.
He said people who have amassed wealth by illegal means are not suffering, but those who do not have black money are facing hardships.
"Unfortunately, people who needed to be attacked have gone scot-free," he said, adding that one section of "suited-booted" people was still leading a life of luxury.
Ramesh, a former Union Cabinet minister, claimed that BJP was spreading misinformation that Congress and other parties have called for a 'Bharat bandh'.
The Opposition parties will hold protests across the country by observing "Jan Aakrosh Diwas", he said.
Taking a swipe at the Modi government, he said economic activity has anyway come to a standstill since November 9.
Asked what will be the Opposition's strategy in Parliament, Ramesh said a debate will happen if the Prime Minister participates in it.
The Congress leader also questioned government's preparedness to bring in new currency notes, saying that according to estimates, it may take up to 250 days to print new notes and bring economy back on the track.
He also criticised the Prime Minister's call for a "cashless" or "less-cash" society, saying that in India, a majority of people use cash for daily transactions."
"Such things take time and cannot be forced by giving shocks," Ramesh said.
Asked why Congress' ally Nitish Kumar was not in the favour of protests against demonetisation, Ramesh said JDU leader Sharad Yadav was supporting it.
He claimed that the Pune-based organisation, which is said to be behind the demonetisation idea, has also said the way it is being implemented is not what they had suggested.
Congress was not against the objectives of the measure and will support steps against black money and corruption, but the reality of the situation is different, he said.
Only two per cent of people in the country undertake cashless transactions. It will take time before the country becomes cashless, he said.
The Prime Minister, who believes in "sound bytes", has been talking of "cashless and less-cash society. Does he want cashless mandis also?" the Congress leader asked.
Citing National Investigation Agency (NIA) estimates, he said counterfeit notes make up just 0.02 per cent of the total currency in circulation. To tackle this, 80 per cent of
people, be it farmers, the unorganised and small-scale sector have been subjected to inconvenience.
Accusing the Prime Minister of making tall claims, Ramesh said an action plan should have been readied and the shortcomings examined.
He said it is estimated that only 5-10 per cent of black money is kept in cash, while most of it is in the form of gold, silver, benami property or stashed abroad.
A lot of discomfiture had been caused to people by demonetising Rs 500 notes abruptly, he said.
The Prime Minister had remarked "na khaaonga, na khaane doonga", but Saurabh Patel, who was a minister in the then Modi-led Gujarat government, is learnt to have been linked to a company based in Bahamas, where many tax evaders go, Ramesh alleged.
Asked if Congress was in favour of holding of Lok Sabha and Assembly elections simultaneously, Ramesh said there were merits as well as demerits of it.
In 2002, a Congress party committee headed by Manmohan Singh had suggested that there should be state funding of elections, he said, adding that various state elections also enforced accountability.

Kochi: With the toll collection resuming at toll plazas along the National Highways from Friday midnight onwards, a main worry of motorists will be to hand over smaller denomination notes. The Kumbalam toll plaza operator, engaged by the National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) for operation and maintenance of the Edappally-Aroor stretch, has come up with prepaid cash cards to tide over the note shortage crisis post demonetization.
“The aim is to avoid difficulty on both parts. Motorists can purchase the prepaid cards using the old Rs 500 notes too. Though no minimum amount has been set to charge the card, it will be better to opt for high value charges of up to Rs 500, (25 rides) in view of shortage of small denomination currencies,” said Sahadevan Nambiar, CEO, OMT Concessionaire.
Instructions have been doled out to staff to provide changes upon a motorist availing for a minimum Rs 300 card using the old Rs 500 note, the official said. Payment through debit or credit cards, for which Point of Sale (POS) swiping machines are installed at the plaza, and monthly pass were the other options before the motorists. No time limit has been fixed and these cards can be used till the charged amount is exhausted.
While the operators assure swiftness upon using the prepaid cards, motorists remain apprehensive that swiping the debit/credit cards, which entails feeding of the pin number, may hold them up. The toll plaza collects between Rs 20 and Rs 140 depending on the type of vehicle. Vehicles passing through the plaza are classified into seven categories and charged accordingly.

Bhopal: The current cash crunch caused by demonetization of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes may have made many couples to wait to enter wedlock, but not this love-struck budding bureaucrat duo.
IAS couple — Ashis Vasisth and Saloni Sidana — both of 2004 batch, have beaten the cash crunch to tie the knot by shelling out just Rs 500. Even, the money they spent was in form of marriage registration fee.
The couple was declared man and wife by the presiding officer at the additional district magistrate court, Bhind, in Madhya Pradesh on Monday. According to Bhind district collector T. Ilaya Raja, who was one of the witnesses in the marriage, Mr Vashisth who is currently posted in Gohad in MP as sub-divisional magistrate had applied for registration of his marriage with his batch-mate Salone Sidana, currently serving as SDM, Vijayawada in AP, in the Bhind court which had notified November 28 as their date of registration.

KOZHIKODE: In an attempt to crack down on blackmoney, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the withdrawal of two major currency denominations – Rs 1000 and Rs 500 notes. It has met with wide ranging reactions from the public and polity. Youngsters from the city talk to DC how badly demonetization has affected their professional as well as personal lives. “While this may prove a major boost for people to use digital means of transactions, there are a lot more ramifications for the larger public”, said Shigil NP, an entrepreneur from the city.
"On one hand, this move to combat tax evasion and end blackmoney is the best-ever decision a prime minister of the country so far has taken. But on the other hand, the decision has widely affected young entrepreneurs like me, as we are still working on minimal money. To pay our employees and carry out business has been hindered with this issue", he added. Sadam Shad, a young businessman hailing from Kozhikode, said that he was in trouble a few days ago, when a private hospital in Kozhikode did not accept a credit card. "I had to run from pillar to post in order to arrange a few new currencies to settle my bills with the hospital. Not just in my personal affairs, but in my business too I am facing a tough time as people are not able to do business with insufficient currencies", he added.
But welcoming the move, Swarna Unnikrishnan, a women entrepreneur from the city, said, “This is one of the best promising moves made by the PM towards a cashless economy”. Electronic payment methods would spread across the nation which would initially help emerging entrepreneurs to put in more innovative ideas into this sector, she said. "Initiation difficulties should not be a matter of worry as these steps would help the public and the nation to see the country free from counterfeit notes and stop the flow of blackmoney, she added.

Guwahati: In what has created a sensation in Arunachal Pradesh, more than Rs 1300 crore, suspected to be black money, was deposited in few bank accounts in the state.
Though, SBI officials refused to divulge the specific bank details, sources in the bank admitted that they have recorded the deposit of Rs. 800 crore in the state soon after demonetisation.
A local daily of Itanagar, the Eastern Sentinel claimed that Rs 1300 crore was deposited in 15 bank accounts of SBI in Itanagar after demonetisation of currency. The editor of the newspaper claimed that they published the story three days back on the basis of information provided by SBI officials. “The bank has neither contradicted our story nor clarified it as yet,” the editor of the local daily said.
Claiming that banks have informed the authorities about these deposits, security sources said that suspicion on clandestine transactions in the frontier state started following the suicide of a HDFC branch manager at Naharlagun in a mysterious circumstance.   
HDFC branch manager Rituparna Gohain has also left a suicide note, in which he confessed and named few contractors and politicians who exchanged and deposited demonetised currency in his branch to which he could reconcile in the accounts of the bank, security sources said. The suicide note is with the police.
Asserting that a huge of amount of currency was smuggled to Itanagar from Assam only a day after demonetization of currency, security sources said that the HDFC branch manager was under pressure from various quarters to justify their clandestine exchange and deposits. Though, police is tight-lipped about the suicide note as it may open Pandora’s box.
Security sources said that a huge amount of old currency was also deposited in the Arunachal Pradesh State Cooperative Apex Bank branches of the state.
In absence of core-banking facilities with the Apex Bank, security sources said that bank officials have not been able to reconcile their accounts as yet. Security sources said that there were reports of bank officials functioning till late in the night and taking deposits even after the banking hours.
Indicating that many political leaders from Assam routed their black money through banks in Arunachal Pradesh, security sources said that a large number of new accounts were also opened after the demonetization to adjust and transfer the black money from the accounts of local residents of Arunachal Pradesh. It is significant local residents of the state are not required to pay any tax on their income.
Security sources, stressing the need of a thorough investigation into all the transaction of Arunachal Pradesh banks, said that there were reports of exchange of money at large scale from remote districts of the state.

Patna: While the JD (U) led by Chief Minister Nitish Kumar decided to stay away from the protest against demonetisation issue on Monday, RJD and Congress too maintained distance from the shutdown.
The RJD Chief, sources said had directed all first line leaders to keep away from the protest march but allowed only party workers to stage demonstrations against the "poor arrangements occurred due to demonetization drive".
 According to Bihar Deputy Chief Minister Tejaswi Yadav, “The party supported Akrosh march against the demonetization drive and not the nationwide strike because even we are against black money”.
He said that “it was due to government’s poor arrangement that people are facing hardship and secondly the BJP is also trying to show that only their party leaders are honest and rest of the others are a bunch of thieves which is not true”.
Sources said that Nitish Kumar’s support to demonetization drive is being seen as one of the reasons behind Lalu Yadav’s decision to pull himself out from the nationwide strike against the issue.
While Tejaswi Yadav refused to comment on JD (U)’s stand on the demonetization issue, other RJD leaders including some legislators said, “Whatever Nitish Kumar has said about demonetization issue could be his personal opinion but the fact is that people are facing problems and our party is concerned about that”.
Later the ruling congress and RJD along with CPI (ML) shouted slogans against the way in which the demonetization was implemented in the country.

Kochi: The vegetable, fruit and fish markets are the worst hit by the short supply of currency notes of lower denominations. The prices of all perishable goods dropped by 20 to 25 per cent.  Traders said that they had no other option but to sell goods at reduced prices.  “After demonetization, the sale has dropped by more than 50 per cent as a majority of the customers shifted to supermarkets and malls which have the card payment facility. Prices of all vegetables has come down with less demand,” said C.D Saji, a wholesale vegetable dealer in Ernakulam market.
Though many of the vegetable and fruits traders still accept Rs 500 and Rs 1000 notes, the shopkeepers do not have enough notes of smaller denominations to give change. The cost of popular vegetables like potato, tomato and onion which was selling in the range of Rs 18 to Rs 25 per kilogram has gone down to Rs 10 and Rs 15. “The crisis will worsen when the agents and traders in Tamil Nadu stop accepting old notes,” the trader added. Similar is the situation in the highly perishable fish market where the price of  the expensive and most sought after fish varieties like pearl spot, seer fish and pomfret has come down.
“The price of big fish like pearl spot and seer fish has dropped from Rs 800 to Rs 500 or Rs 600. The medium-sized pearl spot was selling at just `140 per kilogram on Wednesday. The common people’s popular varieties like mackerel and sardine also went down to Rs 140 per kg from Rs 200 to Rs 250,” said K.H Kasim, a fish vendor at Kaloor. The situation is no different when it comes to fruits. The price of apples and oranges declined to Rs 90 and Rs 40 per kilo respectively while the fruits were selling at Rs 140 and Rs 45 earlier.

Mumbai: Former chief economic adviser to the erstwhile Congress-led Manmohan Singh government has said that the BJP-led Narendra Modi government’s move to ban the high value currency notes is "hurting people who aren’t its intended targets". 
Basu who advised the government of India on economic affairs during 2009-12 writes in his New York Times opinion piece ‘In India, black money makes for a bad policy’ that demonetization was ostensibly implemented to combat corruption, terrorism financing and inflation.
“But it was poorly designed, with scant attention paid to the laws of the market, and it is likely to fail,” Basu writes. 
Basu is of the opinion that more pain would be in offing for common man as a colossal Rs 14 lakh crore worth currency notes in circulation were suddenly withdrawn from the banking system.
“India’s economic growth is bound to nose-dive,” he mentions in his NYT piece. According to him, rupee could also depreciate as people and investors likely to move to more robust currencies.

Dehradun: Accusing BJP of buying land worth crores of rupees in many states shortly before demonetisation, former Haryana Chief Minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda on Thursday claimed it indicates that party insiders knew about the move in advance.
"On one hand, hapless middle class people have to queue up outside ATMs and banks for hours for their own money; while on the other, lakhs and crores of rupees in black money is being recovered from the possession of BJP leaders.
"Not only that, purchase of land worth crores of rupees by BJP in several states shortly before demonetization shows party insiders and its industrialist friends knew about it in advance," Hooda alleged, in Dehradun.
The Congress leader also accused the Narendra Modi government of "making" the poor stand in queues to for their own money and using the Rs 600 crore deposited in the banks after demonetisation for "repaying debts of Rs 600 lakh crore of its industrialist friends".

A surgical strike is when you destroy specific enemy targets with no or minimal collateral damage; carpet bombing is when you bomb a large area hoping to destroy a few hidden targets with a high collateral damage. So let's demystify the so called surgical strike on black money !
Ill-conceived, poorly-managed and wrongly-targeted are mild words when it comes to describe the recent move of Modi Sarkaar of demonetising Rs 500 and Rs 1000 notes. It's more about show than substance !
Many people ask me why I have a problem with the demonetisation decision considering I have been a part of the fight against corruption over the last few years ?
It's being said that to cure an illness that you need to take a bitter medicine. Yes, that's true but you administer the medicine to the people suffering from the illness, not those who don’t! Delivering unwarranted medicine can prove very harmful.  This move has hit the bottom of the pyramid the hardest
Common man's woes:
It is important to recognise that the target is black money and not the liquid cash used by millions of citizens. We are far from being a cashless society, crores of people still don't have bank accounts let alone credit or debit cards. They earn so little and struggle to make ends meet that savings are a far dream. For such people the lack of liquidity, even if temporary, is devastating as it affects their basic needs of food, health care, mobility, etc. Crores of people are being subjected to unimaginable hardship just to be able to use their own hard earned monies.
Trade and small businesses:
Large notes are believed to be over 80% of liquid cash in circulation. Sucking it out in one go without adequate alternate arrangement will certainly have its repercussions. While overall trade and business will be affected, people dealing with perishables and items with a short shelf life are the worst affected. Traders will probably incur an  increase in inventory costs and this increase in cost will definitely be passed on to consumers. The larger lumping danger is that 60 days of uncertainty and losses will need a recovery period of a year or two.
The Finance minister simply resorted to the adage, “No pain, no gain.” Agreed, but is there a gain? Does everyone, including the honest citizen, need to suffer the pain?  
Has black money been targeted just liquid cash, which is an integral part of our society? It's not rocket science to identify and specifically target black money, and qualify as a true surgical strike! Political funding, bribes, overseas deposits, real estate, gold, luxury goods, etc is where black money is mostly used. Shouldn’t these commodities and services be targetted for a well-intended strike? It's known that 90% of wealth in our country is with about 10% of our population. Why then can’t we define a specific target?
By permitting larger overseas transfers, have we not allowed the bird to fly away? Were the corrupt tipped off? Could this be the reason for the sudden spurt in bank deposits prior to the announcement? A large sum of money was deposited by your party in its account in West Bengal before the announcement was made; was just a coincidence ?
More importantly, by bringing back large notes, will we not be back to the square one? Why are key posts in anti-corruption institutions and judiciary in our country still vacant? Why is a strong anti-corruption Lokpal Bill still in Limbo and why has a Lokpal not been appointed ?
Sir, for the sake of our citizens, I hope I will be proved wrong, but in the meanwhile, don't blame us for thinking that this is just an attempt to project yourself as a crusader against corruption, just another Jumla ahead of upcoming elections in key states of UP, Punjab, and Goa!

BENGALURU: Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s decision to demonetize high-value currency notes could well prove a double-edged sword for the state unit of BJP—a boon for the common man but a liability for the party as funds for elections and related activities could be reduced to a trickle.   
The pros and cons of demonetization were discussed by top leaders at a recent meeting of the core committee with a majority of them reporting that they had received a positive feedback from districts and rural parts of the state with people supporting the ban on currency notes of Rs 1000 and Rs 500 denominations.
Those belonging to the middle class, the lower middle class and farming sector as well as the salaried classes were happy about the ban on notes of higher denominations, a senior core committee member told Deccan Chronicle.  
The leader said the core committee felt the party should capitalize on the opportunity and expand its base in rural parts of the state through an awareness drive. With Mr Modi and the party figuring in most conversations in rural areas, it would help the party to make forays into remote areas across the state, the leader added.
The leaders also discussed about adverse affects of demonetization ahead of Assembly elections in 2018 with many expressing apprehension that the state unit would certainly face a shortage of funds in view of the drive against black money.
State unit president B.S.Yeddyurappa and other senior core committee members opinioned that the party would not be able to mobilize funds from corporate and business houses following stringent action by the Union government. Therefore, the party should prepare now itself to face the elections with shortage of fund.
Sources said the state unit of BJP has already received an advisory from the central leaders of the party about adverse effects on the party following demonetization scheme and asked the party to be ready to face the worst case scenario.

KOZHIKODE: At a time when demonetization has affected people including industrialists, businessmen and all small and large scale traders, it was the snehasparsham project, initiated by the District Panchayath for the welfare of kidney patients that went unaffected during the ongoing crisis. Initially officials feared that their fund target from donations by the public would not be achieved due to the scarcity of lower denomination notes, but funds flowing into the Snehasparsham account have exceeded expectations.  
During the Panchayath level fund raising programme, volunteers including ward members collected Rs 5 crore from the public, although collections were down during the initial days after the announcement on demonetization. On Sunday, the volunteers aiming to collect Rs 5 crore, conducted a massive drive within the Corporation limit, in addition to the fund collected from the municipalities. 
Talking about the funds collected, Snehaspa-rsham coordinator, N Sreeraj said, “Our massive drive was announced exactly on the day when Prime Minister announced the demonetisation. We were doubtful about the fund raising drive due to the scarcity of lower denominations, fortunately we collected much more than expected.”
The money collected so far has been remitted into the Snehasparsham project account with SBT. This year the massive drive aims at helping not just kidney patients but also those suffering from psychological disorders and HIV patients. The future aim of Snehasparsham is to develop a kidney transplant center in Kozhikode which can help patients to carry out transplants at an economical price as compared to private hospitals here.

The Centre's move to demonetise high-value banknotes has struck the "core of terror funding", Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar said today.
"Demonetization has struck the core of terror funding and PM @narendramodi ji in his speech today emphasized on continuing to fight #BlackMoney," Parrikar tweeted hours after sharing the stage with Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Goa.
Modi laid the foundation stone of various projects including Greenfield airport at Mopa and Electronic City at Tuem, both in North Goa. During his address, the PM launched a scathing attack on detractors of the demonetisation move and announced that more anti-graft measures are on the anvil.
In his speech at a function in Pune, Modi said, "Enemies took advantage of the 14 lakh crore of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes in circulation."
Taking the nation by surprise, the Prime Minister on Tuesday announced demonetisation of Rs 1,000 and Rs 500 banknotes with effect from midnight of November 8 in a major assault on black money, fake currency and corruption.

New Delhi: The Supreme Court on Friday sought response of the Centre on the issues including whether the district cooperative banks can be allowed to accept deposits with certain conditions and can there be a minimum assured withdrawal from banks.
A bench headed by Chief Justice T S Thakur asked Attorney General Mukul Rohatgi to seek instruction and apprise it about the stand of the government on issues including the bar on district cooperative banks from accepting deposits in demonetised currency notes.
The bench also comprising justices A M Khanwilkar and D Y Chandrachud said that when the minimum weekly withdrawal limit has been fixed, then why people are not able to get that amount.
"Can we say that this will be the minimum assured weekly withrawal amount that a person can get from the bank," the bench asked and while fixing the batch of petitions for further hearing on December 14.
The bench, meanwhile, proposed to frame various legal questions to be deliberated upon in the future hearing. Rohatgi sought a direction that cases in various high courts on the demonetisation issue be stayed.
The bench said that it would take up this issue on next date of hearing.
The top court had on December 2 asked the Centre to spell out the measures taken to ease suffering of and inconvenience to the people in rural areas.
While hearing a batch of pleas challenging various aspects of demonetisation, the court had said that all parties should sit together and prepare a list of categories of cases which could be referred to high courts and those that could be heard by the apex court.
The AG had said that the government was aware of the situation in cooperative banks which lack proper infrastructure and mechanism as compared to scheduled banks.
The Centre had on November 24 filed an affidavit in the apex court on demonetisation and had said that the "bold move" would eradicate black money and slush funds operating since Independence which cast a "parallel economy" hitting the poor and the middle class.
On November 29, the apex court had agreed to hear pleas of 14 cooperative banks of Kerala seeking its nod to transact business like banks and others seeking demonetisation of any currency note higher than Rs 100 denomination.

New Delhi: Seeking to corner the government in Parliament on the demonetisation issue, major opposition parties, including arch rivals TMC and CPI(M), on Monday held deliberations to finalise a common strategy alleging that the decision was a "scripted scam" which was leaked to the ruling BJP much in advance.
The meeting, held in the chamber of Leader of Opposition in Rajya Sabha Ghulam Nabi Azad, saw rivals TMC and Left coming together with leaders of YSR Congress, JMM, RJD and JDU to discuss ways to put the Government on the mat in Parliament.
The leaders decided to meet again tomorrow to finalise a common strategy as today's meeting remained inconclusive in absence of leaders from BSP, SP, DMK and NCP. The Winter Session of Parliament starts from November 16.
After the meeting, Azad said there was consensus among parties against black money but equally everyone felt that the Government had leaked the demonetisation  information to the ruling BJP and a "scripted scam".
"There was consensus against black money in the meeting but everyone was against the way demonetisation was implemented. It came suddenly and the information was leaked to the ruling party while other parties learnt of it only two hours before it was to roll out. This is a scam and we will raise it in Parliament," Azad said.
Asked if opposition parties will join the TMC delegation to the President on November 16, Azad said, "The question is not who is going with them or who is leading. The question is when to go, which date to go, whether to go mid-session or later."
To a question about whether there was consensus on anything in the meeting, Azad said there was consensus on questioning the Government over the way the decision was leaked to the ruling party.
"There is a difference between us and the Government so far as logic of demonetisation goes. The Government says it has done what it has done whether people live or die. We are saying we are against black money but also against the way demonetization was implemented.
"The government leaked it to the ruling party. Rest of the parties were told only two hours in advance. People are also being inconvenienced all over. We will meet again tomorrow to discuss these issues since all parties were not present today. We don't have to evolve a one day strategy. It has to be a strategy for the whole session," said Azad.

Pandemonium. No other word can suffice, really. Long queues snake out of banks and out onto the streets as people struggle to exchange their now invalid currency. Who are the people in these queues? The lower middle classes, no doubt; our teeming masses who have no access to electronic transactions of any kind. Narendra Modi's move has been hailed as historic, but as the exhausted, harried faces of the public come into view when you approach the serpentine queues, one does wonder if it's worth it. Yes. It is.
India is up for some trying times ahead - demonetization and GST will see to that. The problem, however, lies in implementation and not with the concept itself.
People with bundles of cash stashed away at home will find that their ill-gotten efforts have been wasted. India's economic fate has been significantly darkened by her shadow economy and it will be hit. Hard. Modi's  timing is flawless - the decision came with the UP elections just around the corner. The heaps of black money stashed away for campaigns will now be of no use! Temples are seeing a wave of popularity as the corrupt throng their gates trying to dispose of black money in the ever-forgiving handi.
Those who are intended to suffer will actually do so. Terrorists and criminals engaging in Hawala operations will find it exceedingly troublesome to get their work done. And that's a good thing. That being said, it would be terribly wrong to undermine the hardships of the aam aadmi, what with the struggle to get rid of old currency and the challenges of breaking a Rs 2000 note.
Banks are doing everything in their power to deal with the sudden influx of customers, working overtime, through weekends and setting up additional counters to hand out change. The currency crunch, however, has left them with no choice but to issue Rs 2000 notes, which has hit the common man harder than we would like to accept.
For starters, the government's move triggered widespread panic on the streets. This is very disheartening to witness, because things could have been done right. Procuring our daily necessities like milk and eggs has become a near-insurmountable challenge, especially for the lower-income groups. Why weren't these things considered before the decision was taken?
ATMs, unsurprisingly, are running out of cash as well, only compounding banks' woes. Smaller traders struggle to conduct their everyday transaction - what does a small-time vendor do when even banks run out of currency?
The middle class, despite its incessant complaining, has a much easier deal. The use of debit and credit cards is widespread enough to make this transition a fairly smooth one for the plugged-in Indian. We can go to shops and restaurants that deal in electronic transactions, after all. It's the people without any of these privileges - thousands of people in this country don't even have a bank account. Where do they go?  To whom can they turn? The only class of people who profit from this are the larger traders.
The Goods and Services tax, which will be rolled out soon, will cause the next big flurry. It is likely to send up the prices of many goods and commodities and the Income Tax department will have to make huge changes as well.
The move to demonetize old currency notes hit like a tsunami, sweeping away the foundations of our economy. Private hospitals, despite being responsible for a service as basic as healthcare, have refused to accept old notes. Post offices are staggering under the weight too, simply unable to match demand of this magnitude.
Still, there is a silver lining. Despite the short-term challenges, there is much to hope for in all this. Indians don't bat an eyelid at the thought of waiting six hours for a glimpse of Lord Tirupati, why then, do we balk at the idea of spending an hour at the bank? Perhaps the need to complain has been ingrained into our culture!
The government could have arranged for extra currency. Solutions can be put forth liberally now and it won't change a thing. All said and done, though, I support this move by the Narendra Modi government, because despite a failure in implementation, it will achieve what it set out to – root out the underbelly of an otherwise flourishing economy.

KOZHIKODE: The real estate sector in the high-ranges of Malabar would be one of the most affected financial sectors due to the demonetization drive of the NDA government, and it would be cleansed off black money, feel market players. The unaccounted money from hawala operators and gold smuggling rackets from the plains had been a catalytic factor in the real estate business of the region. More than 80 percent of the money in large deals was ‘black’ which would now stop, pointed out stakeholders.
The impact would be higher in elite property deals of more than Rs 50 lakh while it would be lesser in cases of small house plots. P.N. Ashokan, a real estate agent at Sulthan Bathery, told DC that it would take years for the industry to come out of the paralysis as unaccounted money constituted the lion’s share of major real estate deals in Wayanad. “In our inner circle terminology we call it ‘Kuzhal panam’ or ‘Koya money’ which augmented the business in the sector,”  Mr Ashokan said.
Those who had unaccounted money pumped it into land deals resulting in an increase in the market value of land. "There are many deals in which plantations, resorts and prime properties were sold out far above the market value”, he added.   For the real estate sector of Malabar which was on a revival phase after the Gadgil committee report, it was another shocker, it was pointed out.
The repeated agitations led by the church against the Gadgil recommendations scared off buyers which kept off investors. Vehicle and Real Estate Agents Association leader Chandran Manichira told DC that for the next few months, the real estate sector would be dead. Confederation of Real Estate Developers Association of India (Credai), Calicut chapter president M A Mehaboob told DC that the move was good for the economy as well as the sector in the long run.

Ever since the corporate form was “invented” — in its earliest avatar as the collective East India Companies — those who have ruled via corporation have found innovative “means” new to extract wealth from the earth and people, leaving both poorer in a zero-sum “game”. During the Raj — Company Raj — extraction was carried out through lagaan (taxation on land and agriculture). Between 1765 and 1815, the Company is recorded to have pirated £18 million annually from India. Fifty per cent of the produce was taken as lagaan, creating famines like the Great Bengal Famine. The Company destroyed the people’s circular, sustainable and just economies — in which 70 per cent of the value of what rural areas produced circulated in the village economy — and replaced them with linear, extractive economies, where most wealth produced in India went to enrich England.
In recent years, the corporate empire has found new instruments of extraction, with patents and “capitalisation”, being two prominent ones. The chemical/biotech/seed industry “innovated” and “invented” patents on life and patents on seeds, as a means to extract profits from farmers. The second instrument — capitalisation — the financialisation of the economy is equally perverse. It has punished real people, marginalised the real wealth that people produce in real economies, and rewarded only the capitalists. The capital economy has become 70 times bigger than the real economy. The Wall Street crash of 2008 was a result of the creation of this global casino. We were protected, insulated in India because our economy was still real. The concentration of the world’s wealth in the hands of the one per cent is a consequence of patentisation, capitalisation, and the digitisation of our lives. The latest bait and switch being used by globalised corporate power — to worm its way into Indian households — is the demonising or “demonetisation” of Indian currency.
The “demonetisation” of India’s economy of more that one billion people on November 8 is the next gamble of the corporate empire to steal people’s wealth, lock it away behind an encryption key and shut down people’s economies overnight, leaving only the parts of the economy willing to indulge the payment-gateway-keeper. Naspers Group is that gatekeeper for Digital India. More than 90 per cent of India functions on cash to sustain the people’s economy. Cash is a neutral form of money, one person’s hard-earned money is as potent as another’s; there are no “AMEX Black” Rs 1,000 notes yet. Eighty-six per cent of the currency was made illegal overnight, but that is a dehumanised number. If a chaiwallah accumulates the change he earns, exchanging for Rs 100, then Rs 500, working his way up to a collection of Rs 1,000 notes as his savings. He prefers Rs 1,000 because they are easier to carry and secure, specially since he does not have a bank account — because he has no address — because he can’t afford to rent an address and has not inherited one. At the stroke of midnight on November 8, this chai-but-no-house-wallah disappeared from the economy. A Nescafé machine will replace him.
The purest currency in people’s economies is life, it is love, it is community and communion, and it is trust. That is why most civilised societies, when measured in terms of humanity, happiness and well being, are societies based on barter. When cash becomes the currency of exchange, it can still build community through face-to-face transactions. People’s economies are based on solidarity. Just as patents on seeds were an illegitimate attempt to criminalise farmers by making seed savings illegal, “demonetisation” is an illegitimate attempt to criminalise the people’s economy, which is 80 per cent of India’s real economy. That this is the aim is clear from the statement of the man who became the richest in the world through patents and the digital economy — Bill Gates. As he stated in his speech for the “Niti-Lectures series: Transforming India” in the presence of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Cabinet colleagues, “the government’s bold move to demonetise high-value denominations and replace them with new notes with high-security features was an important step to move away from the shadow economy to a more transparent economy.”
Mr Gates said digital transactions would rise dramatically, and, in the next several years, India would become one of the most digitised economies not just by size, but percentage as well. The “Pirate of Silicon Valley” has just declared the vibrant community-based swadeshi economy of the people of India a “shadow” economy, just because it is beyond the reach of his digital monopoly. We are not shadows of your empire, Mr Gates. We are hard-working, honest people who still know how to trust and share, who have community and real creativity to run and sustain our economy. Transparency as defined by you as the asymmetric power of the financial and digital world over people, to take control of our wealth, our well being, our lives and our freedoms. It is the end of being in a relationship of trust with a person you know in your local economy, and see face to face. It is the end of people being transparent to each other as human beings. It is not financial transparency either that is supposed to end “black money”.
You and Microsoft are part of the “black economy”. A 2012 report from the US Senate found that Microsoft’s use of offshore subsidiaries enabled it to avoid taxes of $4.5 billion, a sum greater than the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation annual grant-making ($3.6 billion in 2014). You want to teach us transparency? In 1857, we drove out the first corporation that ruled the world, the East India Company. In 1947, we drove out the British who controlled 80 per cent of the territories of the world. Our determination to defend our economic freedoms, economic democracy and economic sovereignty through swadeshi is stronger than ever. The need for swadeshi has never been greater. We will defend and sustain our people’s economies — by the people, of the people, for the people, against the assault of the corporate economy run by the corporations, for the corporations.

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Finance minister Thomas Isaac said that even as salary and pension distribution on the first-day of the month went off smoothly, the scenario may turn grim in the coming days unless the banks allotted sufficient funds. “Reserve Bank of India and other banks had initially promised to give Rs 500 crore in the initial days of the month. Later, citing currency shortage banks promised to release at least Rs 167 crore for the initial days. However, only Rs 111 crore was distributed till this evening. Unless the remaining funds are given, the situations may become tight in the coming days. The Centre is bound to release the funds,” said Dr Isaac.
He said that not even a single penny was allotted by banks to 12 treasuries till evening. Till 11.30 am, 42 treasuries did not receive a single penny from banks. Most of these were in rural parts of the state. The government also directed treasuries to advice customers that since core banking facility was enabled in treasuries, customers could withdraw money from any treasury. Treasuries were also directed not to deny maximum of Rs 24,000 by individuals. Dr Isaac also said that it would take a minimum of three hours for salaries to get credited in banks after bills were passed. Hence, employees should not get scared if they did not find money in their accounts immediately after bills were passed.
Reacting to allegations that the government was creating unnecessary scare, Dr Isaac said that he was only telling the facts and even initiating steps to reduce inconvenience caused to people as a result of demonetisation. He also said that employees of private establishments would be badly hit as disbursement of salaries would be affected. The finance minister said that demonetisation was turning out to a damp squib. Studies indicated that Rs 1.2 lakh crore was required for the demonetisation exercise.
The present trend shows that the only around Rs 1 lakh crore black money could be unearthed with demonestisation. Meanwhile in Kollam, Dr Isaac said it was impossible to distribute salary without enough currency notes.   “Out of Rs 9.2 cr demanded by the district, only Rs 7.5 crore was received on Thursday. The sub treasuries including Chathannoor and Paravur did not get any money while Karunagappally treasury received money only by afternoon,” said Dr Isaac. “The situation in other districts is much more serious. In several treasuries in the state, there existed a situation that the received money was insufficient to pay off salaries,” he said.

New Delhi: More than 93 per cent of the five lakh people who participated in a survey on Narendra Modi App have supported demonetisation, the PMO said today a day after the Prime Minister sought public feedback on the issue. "I thank people for the historic participation in the survey.
It's satisfying to read the insightful views & comments," the Prime Minister tweeted along with the results of the survey conducted on Narendra Modi App. "Unprecedented response to App Survey, record number of citizens share their view," said the title of a write-up on narendramodi.in whose link was shared by the Prime Minister on his twitter account.
The survey result was read out by IT and Telecom Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad at Cabinet meeting this evening, prompting the Prime Minister to say that it "reflects the mood" of the people.
In just over 24 hours of the survey, more than 5 lakh people have participated and expressed their opinion, it said, adding "This is a staggering number by any stretch. No opinion survey conducted in India, on such policy or political issues, even comes close to sampling so many responses."
More than 93 per cent people support the move to demonetize the old 500 and 1000 rupee notes, it said. Of the over 5 lakh responses so far, only 2 per cent have rated the move as 'very poor' or 'one star', the survey result said.
More than 90 per cent of the respondents feel the government’s move to tackle black money is above four-star rating, the survey result says. 73 per cent of them give it five-star rating of 'brilliant'.
On the overall fight against corruption, more than 92 per cent of respondents either rate the government as 'very good' or 'good' while 57 per cent of them rate the fight as 'very good'.
"As high as 86 per cent people believe that some so- called anti-corruption activists are now actually batting in support of black money, corruption and even terrorist financing!", the write-up said.
The write-up said the demonetization survey was launched on the NM App yesterday at 10 AM and "the response has been phenomenal." Modi's move to gauge the views of the people directly came at a time when the opposition has escalated its attack on the issue of demonetisation.
Explaining the reason behind the Prime Minister's move on survey, the write-up said Modi's "belief in participative governance and direct engagement with people is unwavering" and "time and again, he has directly engaged with the people and sought their views on a wide range of issues.
"...It was then decided to speak directly to the people and take their views in an open, free, fair, and equitable poll. "Instead of intermediaries speaking on behalf of people,let the people speak for themselves. Let them say whether they support or oppose the demonetization move.
"Let them offer suggestions to alleviate the genuine inconveniences that some people may be facing. If someone has a well-argued case of opposing the move, let them say that too.
Overall, instead of just opinion, let data speak for the support for the move." Contending that the questions to which the Prime Minister had sought answers were "comprehensive and direct", the write-up said the queries also included opportunity to give feedback.
"The overall aim included means to make the implementation stronger and more effective," it said. The questions included "Do you have any suggestions/ideas or insights you would like to share with PM Narendra Modi."
Some of the other questions asked are: "Do you think black money exists in India? "Do you think the evil of corruption and black money need to be fought and eliminated? "What do you think of government's move of banning old Rs 500 and Rs 1000 notes? "Do you mind inconvenience faced in our fight to curb corruption, black money, terrorism and counterfeiting of currency?".

As demonetisation of high-value notes hit small businessmen across the city, sex workers of Sonagachi in Kolkata, South Asia's largest red light area are seeing brisk business as they are accepting high denomination notes.
"Our girls have been asked to accept Rs 500 and Rs 1000 notes. But they are telling customers that they will not accept those after this week. Therefore there is a huge rush of customers. "Although sex workers in top categories are facing no problem but those who take only Rs 300 to Rs 400 are facing great difficulty," said Bharati, the mentor of the Durbar Mahila Samanwaya Committee, a sex workers' organization which has 1.3 lakh registered sex workers under it across Bengal.
Sex workers who charge below 500 are facing a tough time as they have hardly got any customers in last two days. Prospective customers first inquire whether the sex workers will accept Rs 500 and Rs 1000 notes.
"If we say no we will lose the customer. We have to accept the notes and Durbar and Usha bank had assured us that our money will not go in waste," said Rekha a sex worker. In the last two days, sex workers in and around Sonagachi have deposited more than Rs 55 lakh in Usha Multipurpose Cooperative Bank, which was formed and is run by former sex workers in 2001 for women in the same trade.
"Due to the huge rush of customers in Sonagachi, the sex workers in last two days have deposited more than Rs 50 lakh in their bank accounts in Usha Bank. Generally, sex workers prefer to keep money in their homes but after demonetization, there is a rush among sex workers to deposit money in the bank," Shantanu, a senior official of Usha Bank said. In normal circumstances, Usha Bank does a business of around Rs 5 lakh per day.

New Delhi: Senior Congress leader P Chidambaram on Sunday said had he been the Finance Minister, he would have resigned from the post if the Prime Minister insisted on demonetisation.
"Had the Prime Minister told me 'I have decided to declare as illegal tenders Rs 1,000 and Rs 500 currency notes', my advice to him would have been not to do it. Don't take the decision.
"I would have given him facts and figures. But, had he still said 'Sorry, this is my decision and I will do it', let me tell you quite candidly, I would have resigned," said the former Union finance minister.
He was replying to a question at the Delhi Literature Festival on what would he have done had he been in Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley's place.
Attacking the government over demonetisation, Chidambaram claimed that the move will not meet the objectives of curbing corruption, counterfeit currencies and black marketeering as spelt out by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
However, he added that the "only short-term benefits" of it would result in people shifting towards digital transactions in the urban areas.
Criticising the Centre, Chidambaram claimed that sufficient information on the ramifications of demonetization was not provided to the Prime Minister and added that even the Chief Economic Advisor was not aware of the move.
He said when he held the office of the Finance Minister, it came to his knowledge that one of his predecessors had constituted a committee on demonetisation, but did not name the predecessor or specify the period.
Chidambaram has presented nine Union budgets. "The report of the CBDT was against demonetisation. No one considered demonetisation," he said, adding that similar steps were taken in 1946 and again, in 1978 during Morarji Desai's regime.
Chidambaram said while the demonetisation decision was taken in utmost secrecy, it would be wrong to assume that no one in the opposition could have been taken into confidence.
"If you can't consult the opposition, the government should have consulted its own former finance minister Yashwant Sinha. It should have asked former prime minister Manmohan Singh. A decision of this magnitude ought to be taken at least (in consultation) with Sinha and Singh," he said.
The Congress leader said although the Prime Minister has asked for 50 days for the situation to ease out, "putting the poor under this for 50 days is torture".

New Delhi: Taking a swipe at Prime Minister Narendra Modi for ridiculing Rahul Gandhi's remarks, senior Congress leader P Chidambaram said though he too could ridicule him, he will not do that and said Modi should rather answer the questions posed.
"He (Rahul) says mock me but answer the questions of the people, the duty to respond to the question... lies with the Prime Minister... however he is ridiculing and acting (mocking Rahul)," Chidambaram said.
Stating that he too knows how to mock and poke fun, the former finance minister said, "I can also talk like Prime Minister... and ridicule..., however, I will not do that because he is India's Prime Minister."
Chidambaram said though Modi belonged to "another party" and "propagated several policies that we cannot accept, I respect him as he is India's Prime Minister. I will not ridicule him or poke fun at him, I only ask questions, he should answer the questions."
"Why are you (the Centre and Modi) punishing people like this (by demonetising) and what sin have they committed? Why are you harassing people and the farmers... what is the reason...I would like to ask," he said.
He said Rahul Gandhi is addressing people in several states, including Gujarat, on demonetisation and related issues.
"The Prime Minister addresses meetings, Rahul Gandhi is also doing it and the media is giving equal importance to his speeches like they do for the PM and I welcome it. However that is not enough," he said and described the claims of BJP government regarding demonetization as "falsehood." Corruption is happening black money is being hoarded by using Rs 2,000 notes, he claimed and said party workers should apprise people on such "false claims."
"I bow my head before the people for their patience," Chidambaram said, adding people are perhaps waiting for the Prime Minister's December 30 deadline for things to get normal.
"No government or Prime Minister has the authority to inflict so much pain and harassment on the people. They did not vote for them (BJP) for this," he said.
Chidambaram said the Prime Minister should have accepted that he had taken a wrong decision. "He (Modi) is a big (magnanimous) man... had he said that I made a mistake, had Modi sought forgiveness, he would have been a big man," the senior Congress leader said. He said Indira Gandhi had generously admitted that promulgation of Emergency in 1975 was a mistake as it had led to suffering of people (not in Tamil Nadu) and promised to never do it again till such time she was Prime Minister.
"That is why she continues to live in the hearts of people as a towering leader though she passed away 32 years ago," he said.
"There is nothing wrong in accepting one's mistake…there is nothing wrong in saying that I have done a mistake." Chidambaram said if Modi had admitted he had taken a "wrong decision based on wrong advice" and he was not told of the quantum of currency that will be scrapped, it would have been generous.
If Modi had said he was not apprised about the note printing capacity and how many months it would take to print such notes and on the duration of ATM recalibration, he would have been magnanimous, he said.
Modi should have admitted that he had not taken into consideration the fact that people would be hit and daily wage earners would be affected, Chidambaram said.

Two of the things Prime Minister Narendra Modi said he would bring to New Delhi were decisiveness and governance. He has other qualities also of course and people voted for them just as they did for these two named above. Mr Modi is not a dynast and he has worked his way to where he is based only on merit. He has the reputation of being honest and there are no reports of high-level corruption in the Union Cabinet as there were in the time of Manmohan Singh. However, these two qualities have been on display in recent days and we should look at how they have affected India. Decisiveness is the ability to take decisions quickly and firmly. This is often seen as a virtue. Being indecisive is seen as a weakness though often indecision is only another name for thinking something through carefully. And if there is uncertainly or turbulence beyond tolerable limits, one does not decide. On the other hand, the virtue of being decisive can also be seen as certitude, meaning being sure one is right intuitively rather than through knowledge.
Sanjay Gandhi was also decisive. He was barely a literate (10 standard dropout) man who was given great power. He wielded it poorly and Indians suffered in unimaginable ways for his arrogance and his confidence that he knew what was right for all of us. The second ability, governance, can be described by another word used by military historians. That word is “grip”. It means the ability of a general to be in total charge of his command. Knowing what his side is capable of and being prepared. Julius Caesar had grip and he had control over his armies in a time when communications was poor and supply lines very long. Though his record in battle is mixed, Gen. Montgomery is thought to have had grip. He was not clueless as many other generals on the British side in the Second World War were. Mr Modi showed us his decisiveness when he acted to make useless the Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes Indians held. This was sold as an act that would end or severely attack black money. We have not yet been told how that will happen except for Mr Modi saying that the corrupt and the wealthy sitting on piles or warehouses of cash would now only have worthless paper.
Those who have run business, and I have owned and run a manufacturing and a services business, know that black money does not work like that. It is used, just like white money is used, as a means to expand business. It is held in goods and in property. In the purely liquid form, as cash, it is not particularly useful. The second reason given was that it would dent terrorist activity because that was being done by counterfeit money. Almost anything today can be sold as a good idea to Indians if it can be attached to terrorism. The media is less likely to question it. Anyway, so Mr Modi showed a flash of decisiveness. As a result of it we are living through days when the wretched of India, the hundreds of millions of poor who live on cash alone, are being used in an experiment. The Opposition is terrified of Mr Modi, with a couple of parties excepted, and that means that the demonetisation has not itself been opposed so far. Because this terrorism thing was stuck to it, the Congress is too afraid to demand a rollback. They are not sure of the public mood and believe that there is enthusiasm for the act.
Meanwhile, this act of casual cruelty is bringing suffering and trauma to millions. Watching the Gujarati news channels I was struck by how the English ones seem to be reporting from another country. Mr Modi has told us the suffering Indians are going through will be justified by the dividend we will reap on January 1. We shall see. But meantime, having shown us decisiveness, he now needs to show us governance. The government has bumbled along since Mr Modi’s triumphant announcement. It has been doing things seemingly in reactive mode. It has been raising and lowering withdrawal limits, relaxing rules for some states arbitrarily, and introducing ad hoc administrative measures like inking of fingers. Where is the talent and ability needed to bring calm to the chaos that anyone could have anticipated when the government makes a move of this magnitude? It would not be incorrect to say that at the moment it seems to be missing. This is his chance. With the country in a crisis that directly affects not a handful of people (as terrorism does) but hundreds of millions we will know if Mr Modi has grip.

November wasn't a good month, overall, for the Indian economy, and the two-wheeler market was no exception. Due to demonetization, overall two-wheeler market sales declined by 5 per cent. Leading manufacturers like Hero MotoCorp and Bajaj Auto witnessed a steep fall in their sales and also reported fewer inquiries at their dealerships across the country. However, manufacturers claim that sales have started gaining pace and will get back on track soon. What is heartening to hear is that some manufacturers saw a significant growth in their market share. Let's have a look at the sales report of the Indian two-wheeler market for November 2016.
Hero MotoCorp (HMCL):

The market leader managed to sell 4,79,856 units of two-wheelers in the month of November 2016, registering a fall of around 12.9 percent when compared to the corresponding month of last year. The company sold 5,50,731 units in November 2015, which is  70,875 more than the sales during the same month of this year. If we look at the figures of October 2016, HMCL sold 6,63,153 units with the advantage of the festive month and it was the third consecutive month of six-lakh plus sales after August (616,424) and September (674,961). Apart from a figure pretty close to five lakh in January, the manufacturer claimed a five lakh plus unit sales every month this year, which implies that the sales of November is the lowest figure of the year 2016.
Honda Motorcycle & Scooter India (HMSI): 

Honda also faced a challenging November with demonetisation impacting demand in the lean months after the festive, high-faring month of October 2016. However, the company managed to steer clear of any drop in sales and instead gained one percent market share to raise its portion to 23 percent in November 2016. According to the company, it witnessed a steep fall in sales in the first week after demonetisation but made a fast recovery to sell a total of 3,25,448 units in November 2016. That means the company registered a negligible dip of 0.3 per cent against the 3,26,466 unit sales of November 2015.
Bajaj Auto (BAL): 

Accompanying HMCL, Bajaj also saw a sales drop of 12 percent in the month of November 2016. The company registered sales of 2,37,757 motorcycles in the month against 2,70,886 units in November 2015. Bajaj was reporting a consistent hike in the domestic sales this year, along with a dip in the export numbers. However, both the figures showed a downfall in November 2016.
TVS Motor: 

Claiming overall two-wheeler sales of 2,19,088 units in November 2016 as against 2,17,706 units in November 2015, TVS registered a subtle growth of 0.6 per cent. While the company sold lesser scooters and motorcycles during the month, it showed a significant hike in the moped segment. And both the export and domestic figures of TVS remained almost constant with negligible variations.
Royal Enfield (RE): 

Registering a high growth in both domestic and export figures, Royal Enfield recorded an overall hike of 41 per cent in November 2016. The company sold 57,313 motorcycles in the month of November 2016 as against the 40,769 units sold during the same period of last year. With this, the manufacturer has clinched the title of fifth largest two-wheeler manufacturer in India from TVS Motor for the respective month. It is really a noticeable fact that despite offering motorcycles only in the premium segment, RE has shown a phenomenal growth, even during the demonetisation impact on the market.
India Yamaha Motor (IYM): 

Selling 51,106 units in November 2016, Yamaha registered a meaningful growth of 20 per cent as against 42,719 units sold in November last year. It is noteworthy here that the phenomenal growth has been registered despite a sluggish market which impacted the automobile sector, especially two-wheeler segment, in tier-II and tier-III cities. According to the company, it is a result of its worthy product lineup along with innovative ongoing customer-centric activities.

We are now into Day 45 of the demonetization saga and the only thing that’s changed is that truck drivers no longer think they have the worst job in the country, when they look at the guys stocking the 2 lakh ATM’s across the country. 
At the risk of incurring divine wrath one is reminded of the Xmas carol advising children not to pout or shout… Based on recent experience, more of us believe in Santa Claus than the RBI and it does seem as if Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer is replenishing the ATM’s, with Rahul Gandhi at the controls.
Inevitably a vast number of theories are floating around about the efficacy of the operation since we desis don’t allow minor details like ignorance to stand in the way of our expressing an opinion. When short on facts, we blithely fall back on personal experience.
If I had a new Rs 2000/ note for every lurid anecdote I’ve heard I’d be filling the damn ATM myself, but there is already far too much garbage in TV and social media on this painful subject, why add to it?
Instead, let me tell you about this American, Robert P. McCulloch  who was duped into buying what he thought was London's most famous landmark, Tower Bridge, but which actually turned out to be the decrepit 1831 version. 
Robert, who bears more than a passing resemblance to Trump in both appearance and bravado offered $2.6 million and the City Council, privately reflecting on the truth of the adage that ‘suckers are born every day’, grabbed the offer before the ink had dried on the parchment.
Villagers told to hold on to the loot stashed in their Jan Dhan accounts would be better off scamming gullible Trumpistas. ‘This one is same marble table where Mumtaz Mahal ate biryani and nalli nehari, saheb.
That one is cane chair sparingly used for supporting the imperial bottom. Now I make special price for you, one time only.’ Alas, we just don't think on a large enough scale, unless we have blue blood in our lineage.
My friend Jerry headed the Asian operations of one of the world's largest banks not too long ago. Jerry’s CEO, a scrappy, hard-bitten, Brooklyn Jew called Stein had impulsively decided to check out ‘whether the natives in Hindoostan’ were as friendly as the guidebooks suggested.
Accordingly plans, both master and contingency, on a vice-regal scale were made.  Which is more than can be said for our demonetization exercise, but why go there?
Wines of the finest vintage and pastrami from Stein’s neighbourhood deli were flown in, the Presidential suite was reserved, elevators checked and private planes chartered.
Nothing was considered too lavish: all the stops were being pulled out and then some, as Ivanka may have said.The highlight of the trip was an elephant polo match followed by a banquet with the Maharajah of J…
Bank managers and palace flunkey scurried around like headless chickens. Orders were issued, elephants trumpeted and all through the afternoon, his royal highness attempted to live up to his title: the Maharajah got well and truly pissed.
Consequently the atmosphere at dinner was ever so slightly little strained with anxious bankers wringing their hands between courses, praying no imperial insult would come Stein's way. Blood will tell, however, and blue bloods, even with a fair amount of Black Label in the bloodstream, never forget that breeding is everything.
‘You bloody Americans, what? You have almighty dollar and you think you rule the world?’ roared his Highness who was now well and truly in his cups. ‘Tell me did any of your ancestors fight in the wars? Where are you from in America?’ ‘Oh, um Brooklyn, your Majesty,’ replied the hapless Stein,’ choosing what he hoped would be the safest reply. ‘Burklin, never heard of it. Tell me Stein, do you want to become a lord?’ inquired the Maharajah in a sibilant whisper, a sudden gleam in his bloodshot eyes.
Snobbery and annoyance at the American-bashing fought briefly in Stein's mind before the former prevailed. ‘Me? Omigod, yeah, sure. I mean yessir, I mean, yes, your Highness,’ babbled Stein, unable to believe his good fortune.
‘Bring me my bloody sword, Beli Ram,’ commanded the Maharaja imperiously and when it arrived, he solemnly tapped it on Stein’s brawny shoulder saying, ‘I now pronounce you Lord Stein of Burkline.’
Grabbing the turban off the astonished bearer, the Maharajah told the kneeling banker to rise, and with consummate regal panache placed the colourful headgear on his bald head.
On Jerry’s last visit to the Big Apple, he called on his boss and a misty-eyed Stein pulled out a photo album documenting his ‘knighthood’. As he left, Jerry noticed that the turban occupied pride of place in a glass-fronted cabinet. Sic transit gloria.

KOZHIKODE: In an attempt to crack down on blackmoney, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the withdrawal of two major currency denominations – Rs 1000 and Rs 500 notes. It has met with wide ranging reactions from the public and polity. Youngsters from the city talk to DC how badly demonetization has affected their professional as well as personal lives. “While this may prove a major boost for people to use digital means of transactions, there are a lot more ramifications for the larger public”, said Shigil NP, an entrepreneur from the city.
"On one hand, this move to combat tax evasion and end blackmoney is the best-ever decision a prime minister of the country so far has taken. But on the other hand, the decision has widely affected young entrepreneurs like me, as we are still working on minimal money. To pay our employees and carry out business has been hindered with this issue", he added. Sadam Shad, a young businessman hailing from Kozhikode, said that he was in trouble a few days ago, when a private hospital in Kozhikode did not accept a credit card. "I had to run from pillar to post in order to arrange a few new currencies to settle my bills with the hospital. Not just in my personal affairs, but in my business too I am facing a tough time as people are not able to do business with insufficient currencies", he added.
But welcoming the move, Swarna Unnikrishnan, a women entrepreneur from the city, said, “This is one of the best promising moves made by the PM towards a cashless economy”. Electronic payment methods would spread across the nation which would initially help emerging entrepreneurs to put in more innovative ideas into this sector, she said. "Initiation difficulties should not be a matter of worry as these steps would help the public and the nation to see the country free from counterfeit notes and stop the flow of blackmoney, she added.

Money in party accounts
Call it a beautiful co-incidence, but a few hours before the great demonetisation announcement by our greatest Prime Minister, Indian Bank, Central Avenue Branch was super busy. Crores were deposited in Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes. It’s a busy branch, but it was even busier on the 8.11.2016. Rs 1 crore was deposited in one account no - 554510034, in two parts — Rs 60 lakh and Rs 40 lakh, all in Rs 1,000 and Rs 500 notes.
The name of the account holder is Bharatiya Janata Party — West Bengal. In another current account with Indian Bank( a/c no - 8365251388), Rs 2 crore were deposited on 1.11.16 (1. 25 Lakh) and 5.11.16 ( 25 Lakh). The account holder is, again, Bharatiya Janata Party — West Bengal. Coincidence.

Banks needed capital infusion badly
Credit rating agency Moody’s had stated that Indian Banks require Rs 1.25 lakh crore capital infusion
Farhan Rahman’s post:
The Masterstroke Policy of Demonetization:
The media is hailing Modi’s demonetisation of old Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes as a masterstroke policy on curbing the menace of black money.
Really??
Hmmmm.
Let’s have a look into few figures.
• What if I told you that total bad loans of Indian Banks right now is close to Rs 6,00,000 crore.
• What if I told you that PSU banks are in a miserable condition right now, and need immediate infusion of money to shore up their lending capacities?
• What if I told you that few weeks back credit rating agency Moody’s had stated that Indian Banks require `1.25 lakh crore capital infusion?
• What if I told you that in July 2016 the Centre injected 23,000 crore into 13 public sector banks?
• What if I told you that Jaitley said it in 2015 that the Centre would pump in more than 70,000 crore in PSU banks in coming four years?
• And what if I told you that this demonetisation is nothing but a measure to infuse money in those ailing banks so as to shore up their lending capacities?
Can’t you see people queuing up banks to deposit their hard earned money, waiting hours for their turn?
What other “Masterstroke” would have made this possible?
Just trigger the panic button by stating that your old Rs 500 and `1,000 currency is no longer a valid legal tender, and Voila!!! People are queuing up since morning to deposit their hard earned money.
What for? To curb the menace of black money? By bringing in new Rs 2,000 notes? You don’t curb black money by bringing in notes of higher denomination.
In fact, you are now simplifying hoarding of black money by bringing in new notes of higher denomination.
Ok. So what would banks do with the fresh infusion of money from public pockets?
Lend of course. That’s what their business is.
And to whom would these banks then lend their money to?
You? Me?
So sweet of you..
Move linked to increased LRS limit
Well-planned structured money laundering was carried out by Modi before banning Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 denomination currencies.
Last year (May 26, 2015), the RBI increased the slab for Liber-alised Remittence Scheme,  upto $2,50,0000 which means an individual from India can transfer upto two crore rupee to their overseas account in a financial year ..
Before Modi come to the power, the LRS limit was just $75,000. He was elected as the Prime Minister on May 26, 2014. The RBI increased the LRS slab to 1,25,000 in very next month after Modi came to power, i.e June 3, 2014 and also they increased the slab to 250,000 USD second time on May 26 2015. Please refer below link for this LRS slab from RBI:https://m.rbi.org.in/Scripts/NotificationUser.aspx…
Due to the increase in LRS slab, there was a sudden spurt in remittence since June 2015. Approximately $4.6 billion (`30,000 crore) has been transferred from India in last 11 months. This sudden spike in remittance almost 300% higher than historical average remittance. There is no clear explanation from RBI for this sudden surge.

Bengaluru: Demonetization has adversely affected agricultural produce markets across the country, however in Karnataka which has adopted online marketing in 152 APMCs, trade volumes registered 13% growth in the last week of November.
Soon after the Prime Minister announced demonetisation of Rs 1000 and Rs 500 notes on November 8, the trade volume had come down by 39% from November 9 to 15 in the APMCs. During this period APMCs  traded 42,726 lots of agricultural produce valued at Rs 365 crore, said Managing Director and CEO of Rastriya e-Market Service (ReMS), R. Manoj.
According to statistics of ReMS, during the period before demonetisation, APMCs traded in 72533 lots valued at Rs 599 crore. After demonetization, there was a fall in trading by 39%. From November 16 to 22, the market has slowly recovered with trading of 68,514 lots  valued at Rs 443 crore. Normalcy returned to the market with trading of 88,292 lots valued at 677 crore. From November 23 to 29, there was a 13% increase in trading, Mr Manoj explained.
The reason for the increase in trading during the predemonetisation period was predominantly cash-based payment, whereas post demonetization, the mode of payment has changed to cheques due to the cash crunch. Traders and commission agents encouraged farmers to go for online transactions which would help to increase trading, said Mr Manoj.
ReMS  analyzed that post demonetisation  of high value notes, traders have started making online payments in Tiptur market. Around 13 lots of Rs 6.8 lakh  have been deposited in bank accounts of farmers, commission agents and the market fee has been paid to APMC’s settlement accounts.
The state has made huge preparations wherein 29 lakhs farmers have been registered on the online platform and a massive stakeholders education programme was held in 11,000 villages. The environment is conducive now to start online payments, he explained. To assess the ground realities about mode of payment in APMCs and address the problem, ReMS has sent a questionnaire to traders and commission agents in APMCs.
Even a few banks have come forward to encourage online payment in APMCs and also install ATM in APMCs. The ReMS has started negotiations with Banks to tie up with APMCs for online mode of payment.

KOCHI: The demonetization is one of the steps towards the march to a cashless economy in the country, BJP spokesperson G.V.L. Narasimha Rao, said on Saturday. Launching a scathing attack on CPM and the state government, he said Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan and finance minister Thomas Isaac should tender an apology for misleading the people. The governments in other states have initiated steps to reduce the burden on the people due to the initiative as part of economic reforms while the government in Kerala convened a meeting to launch an agitation against the Union government, he charged.
The BJP leader said the ordinary people would benefit from demonetization. “Why should a party like CPM that claims to represent the interests of people oppose a measure aimed at their wellbeing,” he asked. The BJP leader said demonetization was the first step towards the cashless economy in the country.
Mr Rao was in Kochi to inaugurate Jal Swaraj and digital banking literacy mission organised by the BJP Deendayal Helpdesk. BJP state president Kumman Rajasekharan presided over the function attended by Shobha Surendran, A.N. Radhakrishnan and several other leaders.

Mangaluru: The impact of demonetization of high value currency notes was felt by Union minister D.V. Sadananda Gowda and his kin as a private hospital in this coastal city refused to accept notes of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 when they tried to make part payment of bills for treatment of his brother, Bhaskar Gowda, who passed away on Tuesday.
Mr Sadananda Gowda, who arrived at the hospital following the death of his brother, questioned the staff as to why they declined to accept these notes and even asked them to reply in writing.
Subsequently, the bills were settled through a cheque. “I can understand the plight of the common man when hospitals do not accept old notes. I will take this up with the government. Hospitals are supposed to accept old notes till November 24,” he remarked.
Representatives of the hospital, however, cited instructions from the Union government that only government hospitals could accept currency notes of high denominations till November 24. This aspect was explained in a letter handed over to Mr Sadananda Gowda.
Mr Bhaskar Gowda, who was admitted to the private hospital as he was suffering from health problems, did not respond to treatment, and passed away Tuesday morning.

In my opinion, demonetisation of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 currency notes by the government is an excellent move. Yes, initially there will be hiccups as we are seeing, but the people have faith in the Prime Minister and that is the reason they are suffering and bearing the hardship. They believe that it will help clean up the system. It has given a big boost to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and has raised his credibility levels. Former RBI Governor C. Rangarajan has hailed the move, calling it a standard prescription to clean the system, while another ex-governor D. Subbarao too has welcomed it.
The opposition is of course baying for blood. They are blaming the implementation, but not the move itself, which shows that demonetization was not a bad decision at all. Surely a disruption of this nature will have repercussions on the economy. But I think it is a driver for a paradigm shift in policies. Obviously, this is just the beginning and many more moves are required to clean up the system which will ultimately benefit the nation in the long run.
Look at the way it has hit Naxal operations, hawala rackets and terrorist operations. They are suffering because they don’t have money to fund their destructive activities. The people are ready to bear the brunt just to ensure that the system is cleaned up, and the next two or three months will be crucial. It has already benefited the government and has given more mileage to Mr Modi’s campaign against black money. With elections in a few states on the horizon, it will augur well for the economy as massive cash deposits will not be available for the parties to sway the poor. The immediate effect has been a reported 15-20 per cent surge in card and online transactions.
The rural population in the country is reluctant to get into the banking system. Some have even said that the banking system is being imposed on the rural populace. But I beg to differ. I can understand if farmers used the barter system. But they don’t. They use currency notes, which carry the signature of the RBI governor. How can one say that the farmers are not within the banking system? What is important is that we Indians don’t have the habit of paying taxes, and we are reluctant in declaring assets too. We think that the government is extortionist and hence avoid paying taxes and declaring assets. In one swell swoop, the demonetisation will bring them under the banking system.
I think by bringing the rural population under the banking system, we will see a lifestyle change among the poor. The women, who were never associated with banking, too will be brought under the system. Just like the old adage goes, “An educated mother means an educated family”, an economically empowered woman would mean an economically empowered family. U.R. Ananthamurthy once said that the so-called social ladder is a wheel. Whichever way it goes, the poor are going to come up. People are bearing with this move as they are fed up with the establishment and the entrenched system.
Despite the Chief Justice of India commenting that this move will lead to riots, no such incidents have been reported. Now, the Modi government needs to ensure that the poor benefit. Whatever money the government makes from this move should be funneled back into social projects, such as infrastructure building, healthcare and education. The advantages must percolate right down to the lowest levels of society. The fist people who must benefit should be the poorest of the poor.
I would like to say that the demonetisation will help clean up the system in the long run, despite minor hiccups initially which will hopefully be ironed out soon. Rather than calling it demonetisation, I would like to call it delegalising of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes.

New Delhi: Congress vice president Rahul Gandhi on Friday said that his speech challenging the government over demonetisation is ready, but the Centre is dodging a debate and he is not being allowed to speak.
“Demonetisation is the biggest scam in Indian history. I will expose it in the House but government is not allowing me to speak.”
“If they allow me to speak in parliament, you will see what an earthquake will happen,” said Rahul Gandhi
Congress has attacked the government for plunging India into a cash crisis by banning high-denomination notes.
Gandhi alleged that Prime Minister Narendra Modi gives speeches across the country, but fears coming to the Parliament.
"For the past one month, we have been trying to push for a debate on demonetisation. We want the government to debate with us in the House. Prime Minister Modi is giving speeches all over the country, but fears coming to the Lok Sabha. He is in the House, but not willing to sit in the Lok Sabha. Why is there so much fear?" asked Gandhi.
Gandhi described demonetisation as the biggest scam in the history of the country and warned that he would expose the real reason behind the decision taken on November 8.
"This is the biggest scam in the history of India. When I will speak, Modiji won't be able to sit in the House. I want to express the views of common people in the House and want to unravel the scam done by Narendra Modi. I will expose the real reason behind demonetisation," Gandhi added.
Gandhi said, "Layoffs are happening, farmers are dying because of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's financial expertise. It is not a bold decision, it's foolish."
The government and opposition are trying for a debate on note ban, but differences have left the Parliament paralysed for weeks.
Accusing Rahul Gandhi of levelling baseless allegations against the government to grab headlines, BJP on Thursday dared him to speak on demonetization in Parliament.
As both the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha faced a complete washout, President Pranab Mukherjee in a stinging attack Thursday said the House is not a place for dharna and disruption which amounts to “gagging of majority” by the minority.
Opposition members protesting in the Lok Sabha over the demonetisation issue were on Thursday warned of strict action if they attempted to disturb any member who has been called to speak by the Chair.
Himself a veteran Parliamentarian before he became the President, Mukherjee told MPs that they are meant to discuss and transact business and not to disrupt.
“Disruption is totally unacceptable in Parliamentary system. People send representatives to speak and not to sit on dharna and not to create any trouble on the floor,” he said.
“Disruption means you are hurt, you are gagging majority. Majority never participates in this disruption. Only minority comes to the well, shouts slogans, stops the proceedings and creates a situation in which the Chair has no option but to adjourn the House. This is totally unacceptable,” Mukherjee said.
The comments of the President came in the midst of Parliamentary logjam for over a fortnight over the issue of demonetisation.
Noting that Parliament is in session for only a few weeks in a year he said, “For demonstration, you can choose any other places. But for God’s sake, do your job. You are meant to transact business. You are meant to devote your time for exercising the authority of members, particularly Lok Sabha members over money and finance.”
“Fact remains that this (disruption) has become a practice which should not be acceptable at all. Whatever be the differences, we have the opportunity, to speak our mind, to speak freely and no court can interfere in what I say on the floor of the House,” he said.

Thrissur: With the re-starting of toll collection at toll plazas across the country on Saturday after demonetization, toll plaza officials at Paliyekkara here have said that all the five lanes on each side had been equipped with swiping machines for credit and debit cards and a lane on both sides had ‘fast tag’, a digital card facility used on vehicles, which would be scanned at the plaza. The response of the Paliyekkara toll plaza officials came after inordinate delays for vehicles to pass through the plaza since Saturday when toll collection was done by swiping cards and the use of the new Rs 2000 note.
A citizens group led by activist James Muttikkal on Sunday submitted a complaint to Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan seeking measures to ease the difficulty of the public passing through the toll gates. Chief Operating officer at Paliyekkara Toll Plaza A V Suraj told DC that after demonetization such issues at the toll gates were expected and if the public could give small denomination notes or swiped cards it would help ease the delay at toll gates.
Meanwhile, Puthukkad CI Sudheeran S P said that the best way to alleviate the situation would be by implementing ‘fast tag’ at more gates. But toll plaza officials said that as only 80 to 100 vehicles were using the ‘fast tag’ at present they did not have plans to introduce it in more lanes. They also said that as per the agreement the toll company had with NHAI, toll from a vehicle needed to be collected within 15 seconds at the toll gate but it could not be applicable now. They added that there was no clause in the agreement stating that if there were more than five vehicles in the lanes, a gate needed to be opened for the free passage of vehicles.

KOTTAYAM: The rubber farmers of the state, who are already reeling under low prices, are facing another crisis as most traders are staying away from the market for the past two days due to the shortage of currency notes after the demonetization of Rs 1,000 and Rs 500 notes. The rubber dealers and rubber marketing societies do not have smaller denominations to pay rubber farmers. The issue has cut across the district as the rubber production societies, rubber dealers and cooperative societies are complaining that their trade has been affected from Wednesday and many rubber farmers are returning without selling their commodity.
K.C. Joseph, secretary of the Pala rubber marketing society told DC that at least 15 farmers have returned without selling the rubber sheets.    “Most of us do business with cash bundles mainly comprising Rs 1000 and Rs 500 notes. Due to the demonetization we were not able to take the commodity”, Mr. Joseph said. P.K. Radhakrishnan Nair, assistant secretary of the Changanacherry cooperative rubber marketing society, told DC that they had given a receipt to rubber farmers and had assured them that they would give the money when the bank gave it. “We used to give the payment on the spot”, Mr. Nair said.
