The time has come to call a spade a spade. The decision to demonetize with immediate effect 500 and 1,000 rupee notes is the most inane decision in the realm of economic policy that has ever been taken in post-Independence India. In fact, in calling the decision merely "inane", I am giving the government the benefit of the doubt that the inflicting of acute distress upon millions of common people was an outcome of this decision unanticipated by the government, that the government's flaw lay only in the realm of ideas, not intent. There have been other momentous decisions with, in my view, serious adverse consequences for the people in the long run, such as the opening up of the economy to global financial flows, but these have been driven by class interests, not inanity.
The inanity of the current measure is manifest at several different levels. Even if we accept every single argument put forward by the government in its defence, there is still no reason why these currency notes had to be demonetized with immediate effect. The government, as Abhijit Sen has argued, could have fixed the same deadline, December 30, for exchanging old notes for new as it has now done, but demonetized old notes only after that deadline; the panic and the distress would have been less in that case.
But the arguments advanced in defence of the move themselves betray inanity. They presume that "black money" consists simply of hoards of cash stashed away in pillowcases and trunks, which is absurd. In fact, what we call "black money" is an inapposite reference to a whole range of activities in the economy that are undeclared, either because they are simply illegal (such as drug running or supplying arms to terrorists) or because tax payments on them can be avoided thereby. They are, in short, businesses like any other, but undeclared; they constitute a flow, not a stock. Like other businesses, they entail holding stocks of goods and cash. Though the ratio of cash stocks in the hands of "black businessmen" to their turnover is likely to be somewhat higher than that of their "white" counterparts (since the former make less use of cheque transactions), it need not be very high. This is because the "black economy" is not an insulated one. It interpenetrates the white economy: the employees in the black economy use their cash earnings to go to the same grocery and barber shops as those of the white economy, and businessmen of the black economy use the same airlines to travel abroad as those of the white economy (if at all a distinction between the two types of businessmen can be made). Hence the belief that targeting cash stocks in the black economy is tantamount to destroying that economy is extraordinarily naïve.
There is an additional factor here. Whenever such a situation arises under capitalism, a new business opens up with some "entrepreneurs" offering to change old notes into new ones for a consideration. Joseph Schumpeter, a great admirer of capitalism, called all such enterprises "innovations". We already have reports of intermediary agents offering to take Rs 1,000 notes in return for Rs 700 of current legal tender. Since such transactions are themselves black transactions, the government's move against the black economy is thus leading to a proliferation of the black economy. And in this case, any loss sustained by the existing black businessmen would lead only to a transfer of cash-wealth to the new black businessmen, those who exchange old notes for existing legal tender, with not an iota coming to the government.
Let us, however, ignore this proliferation, and imagine that the black economy suffers a net loss, and make a simple calculation on this basis. Let us assume, as the above example suggests, that the existing black operators experience a 30 per cent loss on their cash holdings because of the government's demonetization move. (Even if the black operators retrospectively declare their existing cash holdings as income and pay taxes on them, they would suffer a similar order of loss on these holdings). The government appears to have no idea of the magnitude of cash-holding in the possession of black operators that its demonetization move is targeting. But the figure often mentioned by pro-government spokesmen is Rs 3,50,000 crore. Let us accept this figure. If 30 per cent of this is lost to these operators, then the magnitude of this loss comes to about Rs 1,00,000 crore. On a very conservative estimate, the black economy is a quarter of the white economy, which would place its size roughly at Rs 30 lakh crore. On this the share of profits would be around a half, which means Rs 15 lakh crore. The loss of cash-wealth owing to the government's demonetization move therefore would amount to no more than about 7 per cent of the annual profits of the black economy. Even under these favourable assumptions, the demonetization move, far from being an attack on the black economy, would merely be a pinprick, which this economy can take in its stride.
But, even for administering this pinprick, the entire economy is being severely destabilized, with around 85 per cent of the currency with the public (and around one-eighth of the broad money supply) being suddenly destroyed. Even the other arguments advanced by the government, such as eliminating counterfeit currency, do not warrant this measure. Old notes could have been exchanged for new ones over a period of time, as they usually are, without inconveniencing people and still eliminating counterfeit notes. As regards the transition towards a cashless economy, an authoritarian imposition of such a traverse, instead of a spontaneous move towards it, can scarcely be defended.
The destruction of currency means simultaneously a destruction of purchasing power, especially in the hands of the poorer section of society in whose case the use of cash predominates. It has, therefore, a recessionary impact on the economy whose primary victims would be the petty producers, peasants, petty traders and all those employed by them or dependent upon them, as well as the vast army of self-employed persons. In particular, with the kharif harvest in, the peasants who were looking forward to selling it are suddenly finding themselves without buyers, or with buyers who are only offering them meagre prices in the context of the cash shortage. If the peasants hold on to their crops, then they face the prospect of loss owing to damage to the harvested and stored crops. What the government has done is to cut off the noses of millions of common people in an attempt to spite the faces of a few black operators, and that too with little prospect of success.
It is difficult to think of a precedent for the current denouement. The demonetization of Rs 1,000, Rs 5,000 and Rs 10,000 notes in 1978 by the Morarji Desai government, while it scarcely had any noticeable impact on the "black economy", did not at least inconvenience the bulk of the people, unlike the current demonetization, since they had little access to such notes. Even the colonial government's demonetization of large notes in 1946 was not something that inconvenienced people, since these notes were held only by the super-rich. For a possible precedent, therefore, we have to go back even further in time, to a period shortly after the Battle of Plassey, when the "drain of wealth" from Bengal began. The shortage of specie that such "drain" caused had produced a severe recession in Bengal at the time, very much like the recession that we are currently facing, of which the fall in price being faced by the peasantry is a symptom.
When exactly normalcy will be restored in the economy is unclear. It now appears that it will take several weeks before this happens. The distress, meanwhile, will have been quite acute. What is more, this distress may not be only transitional: the disruption of activity for several weeks may even have an enduring impact on the economy. The peasants' inability to sell the kharif crop may have an adverse impact on their rabi output as they might lack the requisite working capital for it. Petty traders, who are forced to go out of business because of the absence of cash, may find it difficult to resume when the cash shortage is overcome, since the scale of credit required for doing so may have increased in the meantime, and also since they may have lost some customers in the interim, the relatively better off ones, to supermarkets, where credit card payments can be made.
Indian economic bureaucracy has traditionally been of a high calibre. The inanity of the demonetization move, and the utter lack of preparedness for what could follow its introduction, underlines the degree to which it has fallen.

What happens when you let an unsatisfactory present go on long enough? It becomes your entire history. - LOUISE ERDRICH
 **************************************************






Some of the discussion about demonetization has centred on whether it will achieve its principal object in the long term. Will it curb tax evasion, shrink the black economy, squeeze funding for criminals and terrorists? What is the collateral damage caused by the move: is the cost of demonetization worth the inconvenience and pain that it will inflict upon the poor and the shock it administers to the economy in general. Was the sweep and suddenness of the move the best or only way to achieve demonetization's objects? The unspoken question behind nearly every consideration of demonetization is this: is demonetization a political masterstroke that wins the prime minister a reputation as an anti-corruption crusader who walks his talk, or has Mr Modi's reach exceeded his grasp?
Indian arguments are so polarized that each time an Indian economist writes an op-ed or does an interview on the subject, he is judged by his real or alleged political affiliation, which allows one side or the other to discount his arguments. So when I came upon a short post by Kenneth Rogoff, the economist, on India's demonetization, it seemed a great piece of luck. Rogoff has published, just this year, a book called The Curse of Cash in which he advocates demonetization in the United States. He isn't just a very distinguished economist, he is also professor of public policy at Harvard. Who better to instruct the anxious layperson on the merits of the prime minister's move?
Rogoff writes that the Indian government's demonetization targets are the same as those advocated in his book: the curbing of the underground economy and the crime, corruption and tax evasion that it spawns. Beyond this shared objective, his plan and the prime minister's have very little in common, because Rogoff's prescription is explicitly designed for advanced economies. "The idea in  The Curse of Cash of eliminating large notes and not replacing them is not aimed at developing countries, where the share of people without effective access to banking is just too large." Only eight percent of the population of the US is unbanked, whereas well over half the Indian population doesn't have a bank account.
Even apart from the very different banking contexts of the two schemes, Rogoff's plan differs from Modi's in virtually every particular. The first and most important difference is that Rogoff's plan envisages a gradual process where people would have up to seven years in which to trade in their large denomination notes. Rogoff considers the alternative, a fast surprise swap of the sort implemented in India, and rejects it because of the logistical problems and the fact that a slow exchange would be less disruptive of the economy. It's reasonable to infer from this that in a less advanced economy like ours, where many more people transact their lives in cash, a fast swap would be more disruptive.
The second major difference is that Rogoff is prescribing the demonetization of $100 bills, a form of currency that the vast majority of Americans never use in their everyday lives. Even James S. Henry, an economist and journalist who, in 1980, advocated a surprise currency recall with a very short period for redemption, singled out big bills -$100 and $50 - for demonetization, precisely because they weren't used by "your average law-abiding citizen". At best, they constituted a third of US currency in circulation. Central to Rogoff's plan is the financial reality summarized in this sentence: "In the United States, the poor do not really rely heavily on $100 bills (virtually no one in the legal economy does) and as long as smaller bills are around, the phase out of large notes should not be too much of a problem." In the Indian case, the demonetized notes - Rs 1,000 and Rs 500 - constitute 85 per cent of all Indian currency. Far from being denominations unused by the ordinary Indian, these notes are central to routine, everyday cash transactions. Their absence constitutes an enormous problem.
Rogoff's verdict on the Indian demonetization is this: despite bad planning, there could yet be long-term benefits, but everything depends on its implementation and only time will tell. The hedged-about, mildly optimistic banality of these conclusions is partly down to the real difficulty in predicting the consequences of a process as vast and as unprecedented as this, and partly because as the author of a book advocating the virtues of demonetization in the US, Rogoff seems to have a paternal interest in the success of demonetization everywhere.
Since the jury is out on the fate of demonetization in terms of its stated goals, what about the related but separate question of its political payoff? This seems to hinge on the willingness of Indians, especially poorer Indians to cope with both the inconvenience and the real economic suffering that demonetization has caused. There seems to be a considerable body of anecdotal evidence, which suggests that the Indians are willing to give the measure the benefit of the doubt because they see the government's crusade against black money as a nation-building cause. Since the consequences of demonetization might take years to play out, the prime minister, on this evidence, might benefit from the move in the near term, if the inconvenience of demonetization is embraced by Indians as their tithe to the Nation.
In a famous essay, "The Moral Economy of the English Crowd in the Eighteenth Century", E.P. Thompson argued that historians were too eager to correlate economic indicators like food prices with plebeian resistance. In his study of bread riots in England, Thompson showed that the English poor were provoked to action not necessarily when food prices were highest, but when they believed that processes that fixed food prices were unfair and opaque, therefore contrary to their sense of fairness and plain dealing. They rioted when their conception of a moral economy was flouted by grain traders.
Thompson's essay suggests that we shouldn't expect Indians to respond reflexively to hardship with political opposition. Scrabbling for cash alone won't turn people against the government if they believe that their hardship is shared, if they are persuaded that demonetization brings a criminal underworld to book, if they see hoarders and black marketers suffering along them, if only because the undeserving rich have more to lose. But should the government so botch the roll out of new currency that it begins to seem that the State is arbitrarily limiting our access to our own money for an intolerable length of time, or should it become obvious that the burden of this cleansing purge is falling disproportionately on the poor, the prime minister's crusade will begin to seem like a perverse trick, which transgresses our moral economic sense of what is right, and the political tide might turn.
India is a very unequal place and the tipping point for the moral economy of the very poor is likely to be different from that of the respectable poor, or that of the salaried lower middle classes. Gautam Bhan points out that the work of scholars like Anirudh Krishna, who have studied the causes of poverty in India, suggests that the hardship suffered by the poor in the cause of demonetization might amount to considerably more than inconvenience. Bhan argues that the contraction of the cash economy could amount to a welfare shock that jolts daily wage workers, for example, into a debt cycle that pushes them under the poverty line. It seems likely, then, that the very poor will become disillusioned with demonetization soonest, because it radically damages their life chances.
It's possible, though, that the NDA government could lose the very poor and win its imminent political battles, namely the state elections due in 2017. Perhaps demonetization as a political strategy allows for the alienation of the very poor so long as a plurality of voters drawn from the ranks of the rest of society - the 'respectable' poor, the salaried, the aspirational lower middle classes, the middle classes - continue to see the currency recall as a virtuous campaign and use their reserves to ride out the turbulence that it has caused. The Bharatiya Janata Party has already signaled its willingness to punish rural debtors and illiterates in its Haryana panchayati raj amendment bill, which banned the uneducated and the indebted from contesting panchayati elections. Perhaps the party's insensitivity to the impact of demonetization on the indigent is part of a larger strategic vision that sees the BJP building a viable political coalition, one capable of winning elections, without the votes of the really poor. Come the elections in Uttar Pradesh next year, we shall find out.

"When the ship returns to harbour with the hull battered and the rigging torn, before we assess the blame of the pilot, before we award the verdict of posterity, let us pause to enquire whether the voyage has been twice round the world or to Ramsgate and the Isle of Dogs." - Thomas Carlyle
Since he dropped the demonetization bombshell on a Tuesday evening, sending India into a state of shock and awe, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has once again become the focus of sustained attention. As Indians, both very rich and those barely above the poverty line, have grappled with the realities of a draconian demonetization that has put nearly 86 per cent of the cash supply of India out of circulation, there have been sharply polarized reactions to his audacity.
This was inevitable. Demonetization on this scale in a functioning, political, stable economy is unique. Previous demonetization of high-value currency notes had affected only the creamy layer of society and, in any case, had left India's vast informal sector relatively unaffected. The present exercise affected nearly every class of Indians in varying degrees, except those living on the margins of the market economy. The only other examples in recent times - the demonetization of the reichsmark in Germany after World War II and the demonetization of the rouble after the collapse of the Soviet Union - took place under exceptional circumstances and following huge political turbulence. Certainly, pundits I have spoken to could find no other parallel in the world, and certainly not for a vibrant economy.
The long queues outside banks, the ATMs that were emptied of cash and the spate of colourful rumours have certainly affected public perception. In the debate in the Rajya Sabha last Wednesday and Thursday, Opposition MPs competed with each other in describing the woes of the "common man". There were speeches offering a robust defence of the cash economy and the traditional, non-banking ways of doing business. Horror stories were narrated of families despairing of how to go about a scheduled wedding. Others complained about stranded travellers and the British government - influenced no doubt by the English-language TV channels - issued a travel advisory to incoming tourists. On the social media, journalists and liberal academics shed copious tears over the difficulties faced by their maids, malis and drivers.
Politically, the reactions were confusing. While the West Bengal chief minister, Mamata Banerjee, flew completely off the handle and organized a march of like-minded parties (which, ironically, included the very non-kosher Shiv Sena) to Rashtrapati Bhavan, her long time CPI(M) opponent organized a petition signed by some 150 'intellectuals' debunking the move. In Parliament, the general-secretary of the Communist Party of India (Marxist), Sitaram Yechury, compared Modi to Muhammad bin Tughlaq, the eccentric medieval ruler who had tried his hand at currency reform - unsuccessfully. Yet, fierce criticism was coupled with wariness. The Congress veered between trying to claim credit for initiating anti-corruption measures during Manmohan Singh's 10-year rule and suggesting that the whole exercise was a scam. Indeed, apart from Banerjee and Delhi's equally mercurial chief minister, Arvind Kejriwal, others kept their criticism to the management of the transition rather than the objective of the demonetization.
Whether the boldest step taken in the anti-black money crusade initiated by the prime minister earlier this year will fetch political dividends is something that no one is entirely sure about. That the announcement of the demonetization was also accompanied by a large measure of lower middle class glee at the likely sleepless nights to be suffered by the fat cats isn't in any doubt. However, the full-throated expression of support is likely to be delayed until the new notes are in circulation and the queues in banks and ATMs have lessened. Indeed, it may well be a few months before India starts arriving at a considered judgment of Modi's demonetization.
There are, however, certain initial conclusions that can be drawn. The first and most obvious is the fact that the prime minister's authority in the party and his government is total and unchallenged. The demonetization exercise inconvenienced the vast majority of Indians and added to their daily hassles, at least for a short period. But the exercise completely unsettled those engaged in trade, both in urban and rural areas, because they were at the heart of the cash economy that accounts for nearly 25 per cent of economic activity. Ironically - and this is a point that hasn't received any worthwhile attention - the traders make up the Bharatiya Janata Party's core constituency, one that has stood by the party through times good and bad. By hitting that section the hardest and more or less coercing them into joining a modern sector, Modi has taken a monumental political gamble. He has, in effect, triggered a social upheaval in the BJP and reached out to sections that were hitherto not a part of the party's support base. Whether the BJP is able to enlarge and redefine its social base as a consequence will be worth watching. So far, the party has extended unequivocal support to the prime minister but how the tremors affect the social base is unknown. In any case, as in Gujarat, Modi has always conducted a very presidential form of politics by reaching out to voters over the heads of intermediaries.
Secondly, the demonetization exercise has reshaped the image of Modi as an administrator. In 2014, Modi was regarded outside Gujarat as a charismatic leader who meant different things to different people. While his decisiveness and no-nonsense style were appreciated, there was always a big question mark over his ability to effect a fundamental transformation of the country. Indeed, one of the criticisms levelled against him was that he was essentially an incrementalist, not a radical.
The prime minister's anti-black money drive will go a long way in changing perceptions. It is now clear that unlike, say, Indira Gandhi's nationalization of banks in 1969 and V.P. Singh's endorsement of the Mandal Commission report in 1990, Modi's demonetization was more considered and part of a larger calculation. In hindsight, it now appears that the Aadhar card drive, the Jan Dhan Yojana, the drive against foreign accounts and the scheme for the declaration of concealed wealth and income were steps in a larger scheme of things. When Modi argued that he wouldn't take any more excuses after September 30, he wasn't bluffing. It would seem that there is a passion in the prime minister for driving change, regardless of the magnitude of the project. He seems to plan his moves quite meticulously and is thirsty for challenges. It is extremely unlikely that any other prime minister would have undertaken such a monumental challenge as demonetization, not least because he was completely dependant on a sluggish banking sector for its rapid and relatively painless implementation.
It is this single-mindedness that is sharply at odds with political calculations that appear to have totally unnerved both the status quoists (who imagined after two years that they had co-opted him into the Lutyens' zone) and the remnants of the ancien régime, yearning for the predictability of past Congress regimes. Modi has not only emerged as a leader towering above the pack, he has set in motion a political churning. It is likely that the 2019 general election will end up as a referendum on the man.

Take note
Demonetization, or notebandi as it is being called in the heartland, is the new buzzword in India. The phenomenon is no longer a purely economic exercise. Now that the new rules regarding currency have entered their second week, demonetization has been transformed into an intense political issue. In Uttar Pradesh, where assembly elections are scheduled to take place soon, notebandi has been taken up by nearly every neta. Expectedly, the Samajwadi Party leader and the chief minister of the state, Akhilesh Yadav, has opposed the move. Behenji, who is seeking to snatch the crown from Akhilesh, has criticized demonetization too. The Bharatiya Janata Party, on the other hand, is trying its best to make notebandi a success. Recently, a party MP from UP called up Amit Shah, the BJP president,and proceeded to praise the move profusely. Shah, however, asked him to cut short the praise and apprise him of the situation on the ground. The startled MP started to stammer in response, forcing Shah to demand an honest answer. It is clear that a worried Shah is monitoring the impact of demonetization closely. But some allege that the same cannot be said of the Union finance minister, Arun Jaitley.
Say nothing
Not everybody is being vocal about demonetization. Some, like Murli Manohar Joshi, a member of the nearly-defunct margdarshak mandal, have chosen to remain mum on the vexing topic. Joshi was one of the guest speakers at a conclave organized by the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh nearly 700 kilometres away from Delhi. When scribes asked him about his views on demonetization, the physicist-turned-swadeshi exponent replied that he would like to "exercise silence" on the subject. Joshi spoke on such issues as India's cultural heritage and its past glory but did not utter a word on some of the key questions that are confronting the Indian polity at present. Some claim to have spotted the real objective behind Joshi's maun vrat. The BJP veteran is keen to be projected as a nominee for the next presidential election. He does not want to trim his chances by making a loose comment on Narendra Modi's demonetization strategy. But insiders in the BJP and the RSS claim that Joshi would end up brightening his prospects if he were to speak up in favour of demonetization. Will he break his silence now?
Invisible man
The older denominations of Rs 500 and 1000 have now gone missing. So has Prashant Kishor. Congressmen in UP have been on the lookout for Kishor, who was instrumental in organizing Rahul Gandhi's kisan yatra. The word is that these days Kishor can be found in Chandigarh and Patiala, assisting the Punjab Congress and Amarinder Singh to draft a strategy for the elections. There is a theory that is doing the rounds to explain Kishor's decision to switch bases. The chances of the Congress doing well in Punjab are quite high. But in UP, Kishor's other acid-test arena, pre-poll surveys have shown repeatedly that the Congress is expected to finish a poor fourth in the four-cornered contest. A section in the Congress feels that Kishor has dug his own grave in UP by toying with the idea of a grand alliance. What works in Bihar may not work in UP. But is Kishor listening?
Different pace
The November 8 address of the prime minister, in which he announced his demonetization scheme to the nation, was aired at 8 pm. Within minutes, the news spread far and wide, with news channels, the social media and internet portals working overtime. But government-owned Akashvani took its own time to get into the act. Its bulletins at 8.45 pm and 9 pm allegedly made no mention of Modi's new ploy. What was on air were shastriya sangeet, patriotic songs and a panel discussion on pollution in Delhi. Finally, at 10 pm, Akashvani listeners came to know that 500 and 1000 rupee notes would not be accepted. The sky fell on their heads, but only a bit later.
Hot seat
Ever since India's surgical strikes across the border, Manohar Parrikar is being credited with the bold move by the BJP in its poll rallies. That Parrikar's stars are on the rise was evident when he was found seated along with the troika of the PM, the home minister and the finance minister at a function at Ashoka Road.
 
FOOTNOTE  
Common factor
 



Narendra Modi claims that Barack Obama is a friend of his. So much so that Modi has been known to address the outgoing president of the United States of America by his first name. But one hears that Modi has not managed to find a place in an account penned by Obama on his years at the White House. What will also disappoint the PM's legion of fans is that Obama has spoken highly of Modi's predecessor, Manmohan Singh. Obama described Singh as an acclaimed economist, who is respected all over the world. Some have attributed the Obama-Singh chemistry to the Harvard connection. Obama was a student at the university, while Singh was selected for an honorary doctorate by Harvard. But cynics have found another common trait. The second terms of both leaders were markedly lacklustre than their first.

Currency notes of the denominations 500 and 1000 have been declared invalid ostensibly to curb corruption, black money and counterfeit currency, which, arguably, enables terror financing. It is important that we understand the possible impacts of demonetization on the economy and on the well-being of the people.
The Indian economy consists of a legal (white) and an illegal (black) component. The size of the black economy was reportedly about 5 per cent of the GDP in 1955-56. It has now risen to around 50 per cent. Illegalities are systemic to the functioning of the economy. A number of committees have been constituted since Independence to tackle the problem, but they have met with limited success.
Probing the issue of demonetization entails that we distinguish between two concepts -black money and black economy - that continue to confuse policymakers and the people. Black money is a stock concept measured at a particular point of time, such as bank deposits or the supply of money measured as on March 31. It refers to that part of the currency that has been illegally acquired or earned. On the other hand, the black economy is an entity that is measured over a period of time. It thrives on the generation of black income. Black incomes are generated in the legal and illegal sectors. The purpose of black-income generation in the legal sector is to evade taxes. The illegal sector remains outside the purview of national income accounting. Demonetization will help choke the channels of black investments that are financed out of black savings held in cash. The sustenance of such illegalities as terror financing and money laundering through hawala channels will become increasingly difficult.
Mixed bag
How will demonetization affect consumer demand and price levels? Legitimate savings held in cash will return to the circular flow of income. But unaccounted wealth held in cash has now become junk and, hence, will not return to the system. Attempts are being made to legitimize the stock of black money. But the demand spurred by consumption out of illegitimate savings will be less within and outside the country. The Central Board of Direct Taxes will be able to widen the tax net because of the deposits of savings held in the form of cash.
Demonetization is unlikely to dent black-income generation in the legal sector. But it will unearth black incomes held in cash that may be a fraction of the total amount of ill-gotten wealth. A significant part of black incomes is invested in land, gold and other assets. A part of it also leaks out of the economy and is held in tax havens. Transfer pricing, the notional shifting of profit, constitutes two-thirds of capital flight in the world. This practice has also come under the surveillance of the government. A special investigation team has been constituted to look into the matter.
Fighting corruption and unearthing black money are different from the battle against black income generation. Corruption is commonly understood as the abuse of public office. It must be differentiated from tax evasion, which is resorted to by the self-employed and by businessmen.
The current demonetization will gradually cease to matter. The economy will settle down into a new equilibrium. But the impression that the people have been given of the government fighting corruption is only a part of the whole story. The generation of black income can continue as the propertied class remains largely immune to demonetization. Voluntary disclosure schemes and demonetization, the world knows, are not the best ways to fix the problem. There is a need for tax reform, greater transparency and political will to take the bull by its horns. Short-term interventions are unlikely to yield results.

Come closer
Sir â Narendra Modi has visited numerous countries ever since he took over as prime minister. His visit to Japan is of great significance (âRight choiceâ, Nov 15). It has come at a time when Indiaâs relations with China and its western neighbour are under considerable strain. Modiâs tour is expected to strengthen defence and maritime cooperation between India and Japan.  The two countries also signed a landmark pact on nuclear power after intense negotiations. This is the first time that Japan has agreed to enter into an agreement with a nation, which is not a signatory to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. The treaty with Japan would bolster Indiaâs non-proliferation credentials and help it achieve greater cooperation from other countries in nuclear technology. It will pave the way for further economic assistance from Japan in Indiaâs booming infrastructure sector. Modiâs visit has heralded a new era of collaboration and boosted trade relations at a time when the economy forms the fulcrum of international diplomacy.
Yours faithfully,Ramesh G. Jethwani,Bangalore
 
Faulty system
Sir â The article, âThe sentence on Judgesâ (Nov 16), provides a detailed analysis of the ongoing debate on the validity of the collegium system. The seeds of the dispute between the executive and the judiciary were sown in 1993 when the latter vested in itself the power to appoint judges. Since then, successive governments have lacked the political will to interfere in matters of judicial appointments. But the National Democratic Alliance government wants to introduce changes that would make the judicial system more efficient.  The Central government intends to simplify the process of judicial appointments. The existing collegium system is faulty. The only way to tide over the crisis is by recruiting judges with impeccable integrity, courage and efficiency. This may be possible by replacing the collegium system, which gives the government no say in matters pertaining to judicial appointments.
Yours faithfully,Asit Kumar Mitra, Calcutta 
 
For the people
Sir â The decision of the Union government to demonetize Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 currency notes is laudable (âBank on itâ, Nov 11). Such a step was necessary to combat black money and weed out fake currency notes. It is true that demonetization will cause problems for ordinary citizens. But it will adversely affect individuals who have refrained from disclosing their incomes. Demonetization will have serious consequences for such sectors as real estate and jewellery where transactions in black money are common. The parallel economy will now be rendered ineffective and the rupee will grow stronger. 
Yours faithfully,Srikanta Bhattacharjee,Calcutta 
Sir â The ban on high-value denominations is an innovative move, but it is not unprecedented. In 1978, Morarji Desai demonetized  Rs 1,000, Rs 5,000 and Rs 10,000 currency notes to unearth black money and fight corruption. The Congress, the Trinamul Congress and the Aam Aadmi Party are politicizing the issue to create resentment among the people. However, the prime minister remains unfazed by the criticism. He has said that he will continue to implement schemes that will help recover illicit wealth. The governmentâs action enjoys the support of the poor as well as of the middle class. This shows that the citizens are not disenchanted with the policies of the ruling dispensation. The government is thinking of introducing plastic currency. Although plastic notes may be inconvenient to handle, they are more secure.
Yours faithfully,K.V. Seetharamaiah, Hassan, Karnataka
Sir â Demonetization has elicited a positive response from many economists. Leaders of political parties, which thrive on black money, have, however, been left dumbfounded. The prime minister had been preparing the ground for this step. He launched various schemes to bring people in the rural areas within the banking system. Demonetization will strengthen Indiaâs economy. Such a strategy will compel people to declare their ill-gotten wealth and help the country to move towards a cashless economy. 
Yours faithfully,Vinod C. Dixit, Ahmedabad 
Sir â Banks and ATMs are failing to cope with the shortage of currency notes. Criminals and the corrupt are reportedly luring citizens into helping them convert their money from black to white. Law enforcement agencies must remain vigilant to prevent such crimes.
Yours faithfully,T.S. Karthik, Chennai
Sir â Instead of supporting the government, the Opposition has highlighted the difficulties faced by the common people and foreign tourists. The reality is that the Opposition is afraid that the government would reap political dividends from demonetization. The Congress and its allies should appreciate the initiative since normalcy will be restored in a few days.
Yours faithfully,N.K. Das Gupta, Calcutta
 
 
BIHAR
Deep impact
Sir - I cannot question the motive behind the Union government's move to demonetize Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 currency notes, but the truth is that it has led to a complete breakdown of normal life. People are having to stand in long queues outside banks and automated teller machines either to exchange the demonetized notes or to withdraw their own hard-earned money. Owing to the paucity of cash, many of them are unable to purchase items for basic needs, such as medicines, vegetables, milk and groceries.
Even medicine shops are reluctant to accept the demonetized notes. Their problems are genuine - they do not have the change required to return to customers, and are, therefore, insisting that the latter purchase items worth the entire amount of the currency note. The situation is the same at petrol pumps. As a homemaker, I am having a lot of trouble running the household; I have many bills pending.
It is clear that the Union government did not do proper research before implementing a move of such magnitude. It should have had a foolproof strategy for addressing the problems that ordinary citizens would inevitably face on account of demonetization. The fact that the government has felt compelled to allow families celebrating weddings to withdraw Rs 2.5 lakh at one go, and farmers with crop loans and Kisan credit cards to withdraw Rs 25,000 a week shows that it had no idea about the impact demonetization would have on the common people. It should speed up the process of sending currency notes to banks and ATMs so that citizens can resume their normal lives.
Yours faithfully,Shikha Das,Patna
As far as demonetization is concerned, Narendra Modi has put leaders of opposition parties in a tight spot - if they opposed the move, they would have come across as guilty of having hoarded black money. However, the Bharatiya Janata Party's political advantage will be lost if ordinary citizens continue to suffer. The party already appears to have lost the goodwill of a section of its core voters - the trading community, which has been hit the hardest by demonetization.
Yours faithfully,R.P. Singh, Ara
 
 
ODISHA
Critical issue
Sir â The demonetization drive has been chaotic from the very beginning (âCashless and Strandedâ, Nov 10). With the Union government coming up with new ideas on this subject almost everyday, the already harassed common man has to tackle one surprise after the other.  The recent decision of the government to raise the withdrawal limit at ATMs to Rs 2,500 did bring  some cheer to people. But with only a few ATMs working, most people have been left in the lurch. The  exercise is aimed at weeding out black money from the economy. But the sufferings of people cannot be ignored.
Yours faithfully,Satyabrata Mohanty,Bhubaneswar  
Sir â The government should have made sure that it had sufficient cash before announcing the demonetization. More than a week has passed since the ambitious plan was announced. The continuing unavailability of cash in ATMs and the resultant confusion among people have made it clear that the government was not fully prepared to handle the crisis. Because of the governmentâs lack of foresight, there is disorder all over in the country.
Yours faithfully,Naresh Pradhan, Keonjhar  
Sir â The recent decision of the Central government to allow the withdrawal of Rs 2.5 lakh for weddings is a welcome step. It would have been better if this step had been taken earlier. This is the marriage season and people need cash for meeting the expenses. The demonetization exercise has come as a dampener. Several marriages have reportedly been cancelled owing to a shortage of cash. Standing in long queues to deposit and exchange old notes is nothing but harassment. I hope that the new regulation will bring some relief to people who have forthcoming weddings in their families. At the same time, it seems that marriages will become austere due to the limited availability of cash.
Yours faithfully,Sanket Sinha, Rourkela  
Sir â There seems to be no end to the troubles stemming from the demonetization of high-value currency notes. The queues in front of ATMs are getting longer with every passing day. People have been seen fighting with one another while waiting in the queues in banks and post offices. The government has been forced to make amendments to the withdrawal and exchange limits. It is now amply clear that the government was ill-prepared to face the consequences of demonetization. The intention of the authorities might have been noble, but they should have taken necessary steps before going public with the announcement. 
Yours faithfully,Jagatananda Dash, Jajpur
Sir â The discontent generated by the demonetization drive has reached alarming proportions. People have started comparing the situation to Emergency. While one is not sure about the affluent or the upper-middle classes, it is evident that the lower-middle class is in dire straits. There is also no end to the sufferings of poor people in rural areas, which do not have adequate number of banks. The government must extend special facilities to these areas in order to improve the situation as quickly as possible.
Yours faithfully,Baniputta Panda, Cuttack

Personality is the glitter that sends your little gleam across the footlights... into that big black space where the audience is. - MAE WEST
 **************************************************



There can be no doubt that the National Democratic Alliance government is elated. The cause seems to be the much-touted success of the abrupt demonetization of high-value currency notes in its drive against black money and fake currency. Such elation leads to light-headedness. And that must have made the government forget the limits of its power. In the buzz of self-attributed success, the Centre has filed a plea in the Supreme Court, asking it to stay all petitions in the high courts as well as in the lower courts against the inconveniences caused by demonetization. The Centre has forgotten that the government cannot tell the judiciary what to do - or not.
There are two features in the Centre's plea that are truly striking. These could have been considered absurd in their arrogance had they not been alarming too. One is the move itself, that is, the plea saying which petitions the courts should stay. This is a point-blank violation of the principle of separation of powers on which the edifice of India's democracy is based. That the Supreme Court has rejected the plea is not surprising. It had earlier stated that it would not interfere with the government's economic policy, a stand clearly marking out the areas within which each of the institutions is meant to function. But that does not mean that the courts shall close their doors to people's petitions against the inconvenience and suffering that are being caused by the demonetization drive. That is the core of the Supreme Court's reasoning behind the rejection. Besides mentioning that the "magnitude" of the problem needs to be known, and that shutting out, in effect, a route to relief by closing the courts to people's pleas may lead to "riots", the Supreme Court laid emphasis again on the government's duty to find ways to mitigate the people's sufferings.
But it is, perhaps, the second notable feature of the Centre's plea that is more alarming. The content itself. The plea that the Supreme Court should stay all petitions registering the distress caused by sudden demonetization is simply shocking. This government has already distinguished itself by repeatedly trying to gag criticism and dissent in various forms, whether by trying to black out a news channel for 24 hours - postponed at the moment, or by charging and arresting different dissenters and critics with accusations of "anti-nationalism", or by stopping plays performed in university departments, or by pushing uneducated and skewed versions of Indian 'history' and 'culture' down unwilling gullets to silence any point of view that it finds inconvenient. Trying to foil people's complaints against a situation created by the government's mismanagement and lack of foresight is perfectly in line with all this. But this time, it is the mode of its effort to gag all the people - by approaching the Supreme Court - that is sinister. Surely the government is not aiming at an undeclared internal Emergency?

India would have startled Shakespeare's Macbeth. Had the confused king been present now, at perhaps the Tirupati temple, he would have learnt that it was possible to tread a primrose way not to, but away from, the everlasting bonfire. When the government of a country abruptly renders the widely-used notes of two high-value denominations useless in order to make hoarders of black money crawl out of the woodwork, people are apt to get a bit jumpy. No one wants to be seen turning in too many high-value notes to the bank while Big Brother watches keenly, however much the government may reassure the 'innocent'. Ironically, the suddenness of the change, the very thing that was supposedly meant to catch the hoarders of black money unawares, also opened up the primrose way to escape.
Moved by the helplessness of the numerous visitors to the temple of Venkateswara and the temple town, Tirumala, the temple authorities, although they initially baulked at accepting notes of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000, finally relented. But if arranging for free food and water and accepting notes of all denominations as well as credit and debit card payments for prasad and tickets were actions consciously undertaken by the temple authorities, donations to the hundi were, in a sense, uncontrollable. Donations go to the bank every day anyway, a temple official said. But such donations are anonymous; Big Brother would not be able to identify the biggest donors of high-value notes. Even authorities of the Golden temple at Amritsar, who firmly refused notes of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000, could not stop them from pouring into the golak, the temple's donation chest. Reports indicate that donations to around 100 temples and various trusts showed a sharp rise immediately after the prime minister's announcement of demonetization. Since the deity is forever inscrutable, it would be difficult to determine whether this sudden upsurge of religious feeling received the deity's approval. But there can be no doubt that donating to the deity's service was a most attractive primrose way leading away from an uncomfortable bonfire.
Attributing forgiveness to the deity is a human need, and, as this eagerness to turn black into white shows, not always for entirely spiritual reasons. Giving to god removes all taint: the muddy turns clear, the bloodied grows healthy again. Even Saint Teresa of Calcutta believed this. But what is more interesting is the reported interest the government is showing in the spurt in donations. Does the government really believe that the people whose unaccounted for wealth feeds the parallel economy preserve their money in notes of Rs 500 and 1,000? And that they have been quickly getting rid of these by pouring them on to the feet of the deity? Maybe not. But hypocrisy is an attribute of Indian culture; it leaves no sphere of life untouched.

The full economic impact of demonetization will take some time to become clear - both the positive effects and the collateral damage costs. One area of concern is how this move will impact economic growth in India in the current year and during 2017-18. Clearly there will be a fall in the stock of currency held by the nonbank public, assuming that a part of the hoarded cash and all the fake notes will go out of use. Bank deposits will go up but by less than the fall in the currency stock. So the quantum of broad money available in the economy will fall. The Reserve Bank of India will most likely increase liquidity and allow borrowing rates to fall in the next few months. Will this allow investment to pick up? It may not, because business will still be reeling from the disruption and be worried about when other surgical strikes on property or wealth come, and in what form. Hence cheap money will not affect growth in a positive way soon. The second impact will be on small businesses and the informal sector. The informal sector employs around 80 per cent of the Indian labour force and accounts for 45 per cent of the gross domestic product. This has been a cash economy for a long time and continues to be so in spite of the opening of cosmetic bank accounts where some bureaucratic target was met without changing people's behaviour. The disruption caused to this sector may take very long to normalize, if it does. In one blow this sector might have been crippled irreversibly. It might see the eclipse of small vendors and the rise of more formal markets. This will be so in spite of the expected rise in mobile apps that will make small transactions quicker. The third impact will be on consumption demand. The demand for non-essential goods will fall since much of it was paid for in cash. The demand for essentials from the poor will fall because of the liquidity crunch that will linger for several months. Finally, during the days when people have been queuing up to deposit or collect money, the time cost and loss of production for the entire nation have been enormous.
All these will slow down the economy - lower demand, production disruption, and the real economic costs of implementing the move. Economic growth will be hit. The issue is not whether India loses its status as the fastest growing large economy surpassing China, but whether the goals of the currency swap could have been reached at lower social costs and with more enduring results.

Too harsh
Sir â The Centreâs initial decision to ban the Hindi television channel, NDTV India, for one day threatens to violate the basic freedoms enjoyed by the media (âBlackout looms on channel for terror coverageâ, Nov 4). The news channel has been accused of revealing sensitive information during its coverage of the Pathankot terrorist attack. The ban has now been put on hold. But the proposal is shocking and reminds one of the Emergency era.  The inter-ministerial committee â the body that recommended the ban to the information and broadcasting ministry â cannot take such a decision. An independent commission must be entrusted to determine what kind of media coverage poses a threat to military personnel and national security. The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party had supported the Union governmentâs decision to impose the blackout. By the same logic, the prime minister, Narendra Modi, should have asked the defence minister, Manohar Parrikar, to resign after the Pathankot attack. After all, Parrikar admitted publicly that security lapses led to the attack.  There is a need for restrained and responsible coverage of anti-terrorist operations. The News Broadcasting Standards Authority had laid down the necessary guidelines after the Mumbai attacks in 2008. The ministry should have approached the body on this matter. Instead, the government chose to invoke the 2015 rule that imposes a blanket ban on live coverage of anti-terrorist operations.  
Yours faithfully,S.S. Paul, Nadia  
Sir â Facing stiff opposition from bodies such as the Editors Guild of India as well as from political opponents, the government has temporarily stayed the ban on NDTV India. But the reasons cited by the guild lack substance. Journalists must refrain from publishing reports that undermine Indiaâs strategic interests. The media influence public opinion. Hence, they often behave in an autocratic manner. They run a parallel justice system where trials are held on television. The media fraternity must take initiatives to bring about a change in its style of functioning. 
Yours faithfully, Sajjan Singh, Calcutta  
Sir â The directive that was issued by the information and broadcasting ministry against NDTV India reflects the authoritarian nature of the National Democratic Alliance government. The ministryâs decision, which is now in abeyance, is untenable. Many individuals are speculating about the real reasons for the ban. The news channelâs tirade against the Centre on various issues must rank as one of the most important factors. The move should be seen as a warning to other media houses, which are critical of the government. The media are the fourth pillar of democracy. They should be allowed to function independently. 
Yours faithfully,Hira Lal De, Hooghly 
Sir â NDTV India must be held accountable for airing sensitive information during the coverage of the Pathankot attack. Handlers, who were guiding the terrorists, could have used such strategic information to cause more damage. Press freedom is inviolable. But that should not allow media houses to run stories that endanger the lives of soldiers. 
Yours faithfully,Charu C. Diwan, Raipur
 Sir â Unless stringent measures are adopted to keep strategic information a secret, it is impossible to stop it from going viral. Instead of pinning the blame on a news channel, the government must take the army to task for failing to guard its operational details. NDTV India must not be punished for covering the terrorist attack. The journalists, who covered the attack, have acted efficiently and with integrity. They must not be held accountable until it is proved that the story was fabricated. Now that the ban has been temporarily revoked, one hopes that good sense prevails and the government acts in a mature manner.
Yours faithfully,Asit Kumar Mitra, Calcutta
 
Sir â NDTV Indiaâs coverage of the Pathankot attack revealed details of stockpiled arms and ammunition at the airbase. Only delayed coverage should be allowed in cases of sensitive security operations. Airing details and other secret information related to the military must be made punishable by law. 
Yours faithfully, Ashok Kumar Ghosh, Calcutta
 
Parting shot 
Sir â Calcutta witnessed its first green corridor to transport the vital body organs of a brain-dead teenager. This was possible only because of the assistance from the government and the police. The donor familyâs resolve was heart-warming. It reflected a rise in awareness regarding organ donation. People should know that they can donate organs irrespective of age. Such a step can save many lives. Schools must create awareness among students on organ donation. It would be of great help if prejudices regarding organ donation are removed and the future generation encouraged to come forward.
Yours faithfully,Kiran Agarwal, Calcutta
 
 
 
BIHAR
Money matters
Sir - While I welcome the demonetization of 500-rupee and 1000-rupee currency notes, I think the government should have made some concessions for home-makers. I withdrew Rs 5,000 on November 8 for purchasing vegetables and other groceries. As usual, most of it was in 1000-rupee and 500-rupee notes. I spent the 100-rupee notes on small purchases during the day. When I heard the prime minister, Narendra Modi, announce on television that 500-rupee and 1000-rupee currency notes would no longer be accepted as legal tender, I realized that I had been put in a very difficult position. Thankfully, my neighbour's wife helped me out by lending me Rs 1,000 in 100-rupee currency notes. But not everyone has a helpful, friendly neighbour; other home-makers are having a really hard time now. The government should have announced that home-makers can purchase groceries with old currency notes after showing some proof of identity.
I was also shocked to see the reaction of affluent doctors, businessmen and other professionals to the demonetization announcement. I heard that many doctors shut down their clinics because they charge Rs 1,000 as a consultation fee. Several medicine shops stopped selling their goods. The sections of society who have significant amounts of black money stashed away are the most vocal in their criticism of demonetization. There will be long queues of ordinary citizens outside banks and post offices for a few days. After that, though, their problems will be over. Those who have huge amounts of black money stashed away will now have to face the music.
Yours faithfully,Sarita Jha,Patna
 
True story
Sir - I am in favour of the Bihar chief minister, Nitish Kumar, venturing out of the state capital and travelling to interact with the people in the districts. Given that the district administrative bodies are forced to pull their socks up when the chief minister visits, the latter should make regular trips to the districts to review the work being done. However, the yatras undertaken by Kumar do not seem to be aimed towards ensuring development of the districts. They appear to be driven by a political agenda. The people he interacts with are usually screened by district officials who have a lot of secrets to hide. The promises Kumar made during his previous yatras have been forgotten. I learnt from a television programme that he had laid a foundation stone for an educational institute in the district of West Champaran more than six years ago.
The problem with restricted and screened interactions with the people is that the chief minister does not get proper feedback and is unable to see the real picture. Usually, time at such interactive events is wasted by leaders of the Grand Alliance singing Kumar's praises. During the latest visit, Kumar was unable to give satisfactory answers to questions about his unfulfilled promises. It was reported that the police even resorted to a lathi charge at one place.
The possibility that the trouble was created by supporters of the Bharatiya Janata Party cannot be ruled out. But Kumar is the chief minister of all the people of Bihar, not just his supporters. The best way in which he can get authentic feedback about ground realities is if he revives the janata darbar. He should ask police commissioners, district magistrates and superintendents of police to start their weekly janata darbar sessions.
Yours faithfully,Madan Kumar,Patna
 
 
ODISHA 
 Bold move
Sir â The prime minister, Narendra Modi, has taken a bold decision by demonetizing Rs 500 and  Rs 1,000 currency notes (âOut: Rs 1000 & Rs 500 notesâ, Nov 9). In the first few days, the move would cause some inconvenience to the public, but, in the long run, it would benefit the nation immensely. Citizens must not lose patience â this step will help the economy grow.
It is alleged that the Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes were largely being used in hawala transactions and to fund terror acts. The government has played a masterstroke, which should allow the banks to get hold of those who have been stocking up black money.
Yours faithfully,Shaktikanta Tripathy,Sambalpur   Sir â Although the move to demonetize Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 currency notes is aimed at curbing black money, it cannot be denied that this decision has caused immense hardships for the aam aadmi (âCashless and strandedâ, Nov 10). Various restrictions have been imposed on the amount that can be withdrawn from an account. And in spite of arrangements made by the government, it seems that people are bound to suffer from a cash crunch in the immediate future.
After this fiasco, it is all the more important to ensure that everyone in the country has a bank account. Those people who do not have bank accounts are facing more difficulties in exchanging old currency notes. Even today, many in the countryside do not have access to banking facilities. 
Yours faithfully,Manoj Baliarsingh,Kendrapara   Sir â The prime ministerâs decision to target black money by demonetizing Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 currency notes is praiseworthy. However, it remains to be seen whether the move will benefit the nation in the long run. Those who have crores of black money with them should have figured out by now the ways to convert black money into white. Narendra Modi has taken a huge risk. If demonetization leads to an economic downturn, he will have to shoulder the blame for it. 
Yours faithfully,Naresh Swain, Berhampur   Sir â The demonetization move is the boldest decision taken by the government in recent years. It will help catch tax evaders. In case of large cash deposits, people would have to reveal the source of income. However, I do not believe that this step will be able to curb the hoarding of black money. Most of it has already been stashed away in foreign banks. 
Yours faithfully,Narayan Jena, Bhubaneswar   Sir â The lower-middle classes have been badly hit by the governmentâs decision to scrap two high denomination currency notes. Many of them, such as vegetable vendors and small-scale retailers, do not have bank accounts. The introduction of two-thousand-rupee notes would further inconvenience them. The government should have spared a thought for this section of society.  
Yours faithfully,Baniputta Panda, Cuttack

The price being paid
 **************************************************


  **************************************************






Nearly three weeks after the prime minister's November 8 shock demonetization announcement, there is still a great deal of tentativeness over its impact on both politics and economics. The confusion over the scale of its disruptive impact on the economy is easy to understand. Since there is no worthwhile precedent regarding the impact of an abrupt withdrawal of nearly 86 per cent of the cash in circulation of a functioning economy, the pundits are basing their views on possible outcomes rather than past experience. There is general agreement that the next two quarters will witness a downward slide of the GDP. By how much is a matter of conjecture, with some analysts suggesting a three per cent fall and former prime minister, Manmohan Singh, suggesting that a two per cent decline is a conservative estimate.
The estimates of the sectoral tremors are also based on anecdotal evidence. That the cash rationing has resulted in a sharp fall in consumer spending is pretty obvious. From the purchase of motor cars to non-essential foods, most people have cut back on their spending, preferring to conserve as much cash at their disposal - not least because change for the 2,000 rupee note is hard to find. There are also reports that many wholesale markets, accustomed to dealing only in cash, have shut shop. There are also expectations that many manufacturing units that exist on the borderline between a small-scale unit and the informal sectors may suspend business and contribute to lay-offs and retrenchment.
The image of a functioning economy being derailed is unquestionably frightening. Although the media is inclined to highlight bad news - normalcy is not news - there is little doubt that the normal economy has been disturbed in degrees that vary sharply from region to region and from sector to sector.
In addition, almost every Indian has been affected by the demonetization in some way or other. The length of the queues in front of banks and ATMs may differ from place to place and the quantum of inconvenience too may vary. What is unique, however, is the fact that every Indian has been inconvenienced in some form or another.
What is intriguing, under the circumstances, is how little of the inconvenience has been translated into anger and, consequently, mob fury. Apart from an occasional scuffle here and there, the Chief Justice of India's fear of "riots" unsettling the peace has turned out to be largely unfounded - and some would say alarmist. By and large, ever since the shortage economy became a thing of the past, Indians have become unused to the arduous business of queueing. Consequently, the patience shown by ordinary people is nothing short of remarkable. This despite the many attempts by a grand alliance of some Opposition parties to persuade people to direct their fire at the government and the prime minister, the cash rationing exercise has turned out to be an exemplary display of resilience.
In private, the Opposition, too, has expressed its bewilderment with people's patience. The so-called Bharat bandh that was planned for November 28 had to be hastily diluted into symbolic protests after it became clear that popular support for an outright opposition to demonetization was not in evidence. In the few lucid moments in Parliament, Opposition leaders, including leaders of the Congress, were careful to preface their indignation over the inconvenience to people with support for the larger objectives of Narendra Modi's November 8 initiative.
That there is a large measure of popular backing for Modi's attempt to force the pace of modernity in India seems pretty apparent. The results of the bye-elections to the Lok Sabha and the Maharashtra local bodies polls seem to suggest that the attempts to castigate the prime minister for thrusting inconvenience down people's throats have not succeeded at all. If anything, these election results appear to have confirmed that the emergence of the Bharatiya Janata Party as the premier national party, overshadowing the Congress, has acquired further momentum. Whether this will have a bearing on the outcome in Uttar Pradesh next summer is still a matter of debate, but it is worthwhile noting that at least two chief ministers of non-BJP-ruled states have expressed their support for demonetization, after assessing the public reaction. The unequivocal opposition to Modi has been confined to the Trinamul Congress and the Aam Aadmi Party.
Trying to explain popular psychology is always a tricky business - as pollsters in the United Kingdom and the United States have discovered. However, certain tentative explanations of India's very uncharacteristic stiff upper lip may well be in order.
First, it would seem that the inconvenience suffered by ordinary folk who have queued patiently has been emotionally offset by an awareness that their difficulties with the odd Rs 10,000 or Rs 15,000 in old notes is nothing compared to the dejection of some people that stand to lose crores in money kept out of the taxman's gaze. A CPI(M) MLA from West Bengal, for example, suggested that there was actually a great deal of popular sympathy for demonetization because it had seriously unsettled the political dadas of the locality who had made a fortune through their political connections. "At least their swagger has been affected," he told me. This would suggest that there is an undercurrent of a class war that Modi has wittingly or unwittingly tapped into.
Secondly, while the absolutely super-rich may have not been part of the queues, the presence of a broad social spectrum waiting to draw cash or exchange old notes, may have proved a great leveller. Studies of rationing in Britain during World War II have indicated that the measure proved effective because it was seen to be fair. So far, the cash rationing has proved effective because it has set a low limit of cash withdrawal for every citizen, regardless of the actual balance in their accounts. The idea of almost everyone suffering equal inconvenience is more acceptable than a class delineation of distress.
Finally, and to my mind this is important, the image of Modi as a selfless politician who is blessed with impeccable financial integrity has contributed to making the audacious exercise more acceptable. There have been attempts to suggest that there was some insider trading. At the same time, there are suggestions that Modi took no one into confidence. Obviously both assertions can't be true simultaneously - a reason why the demand for a joint parliamentary committee to probe information leaks hasn't really caught on. The integrity of the decision-making process has ensured its short-term acceptance by people whose familiarity with the plastic economy is tenuous.
Yet, this is not the end of the story. Modi asked for 50 days from the people to get things back to normal. It would seem that India has accorded him that space until the beginning of 2017. If he manages to ease the shortage of banknotes and demonstrate some exemplary action against some big offenders, his political stock will go up considerably. It may even pay political dividends in Uttar Pradesh.
Persistent shortcomings in coping with the transition to new bank- notes, however, could jeopardize the larger project. Politically, it could put the BJP in the very vulnerable position of having alienated its ever-reliable trader base without offsetting the loss with social expansion. For Modi, the November 8 demonetization is a huge leap of faith and determination. If he pulls it off, he will elevate himself to a different league of leaders.

Just as terror, even in its pre-total, merely tyrannical form ruins all relationships between men, so the self-compulsion of ideological thinking ruins all relationships with reality. - HANNAH ARENDT
 **************************************************









This week the 'Modi sarkar' completes two-and-a-half years in office, with another two-and-a-half years to go before it seeks re-election. As I write, it is the government's economic policies that dominate the headlines, notably the demonetization of Rs 500 and Rs 1000 notes. However, it is too early to pass judgment on demonetization. The same could be said as regards the Modi sarkar's other major economic initiative, the goods and services tax bill. For it may be years, if not decades, before their full implications, positive as well as negative, are revealed.
On the other hand, one may not be so inhibited in assessing the performance of Narendra Modi's government in other spheres. For instance, when it comes to culture and education, it is clear that those who thought that the Modi sarkar would free itself from the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh and its agenda were mistaken. The influence of the RSS is writ large on this government and its politics. And since the RSS stands for a sectarian and antediluvian world view, this can only be bad for a country whose future depends critically on diversity within and an outward-looking orientation without.
In fact, other organizations within the so-called sangh parivar have also substantially increased their influence. The hand of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad is evident in the activities of the gau rakshaks, who are particularly active in Haryana and Maharashtra, two states where the Bharatiya Janata Party has come to power in the wake of the Modi wave. (Both states have officially sanctioned vigilantes and vigilantism, even seeking to provide 'identity cards' for the purpose.) Meanwhile, the poisonous politics of the BJP's student wing, the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad, is behind the conversion of two of India's best universities, Hyderabad and Jawaharlal Nehru University, into conflict zones.
Many people voted for Modi in 2014 in the belief that he had transcended his sectarian past and remade himself as a Vikash Purush. That, in Gujarat itself, he had marginalized the RSS and the VHP were taken as hopeful signs of what he would do when he ascended to the national stage. Yet exactly the contrary has happened.
The RSS is staffed by ideologues who think and operate in the long term. The VHP and the ABVP are composed of thugs and bullies who act in the short term. Their collective influence has massively increased since May 2014, with unfortunate consequences for the quality of governance and for social peace as well.
Even as it tacitly encourages sectarianism in civil society, the Modi government has gone further than the United Progressive Alliance in the political capture of public institutions. From Indira Gandhi onwards, politicians in power have sought to subordinate the bureaucracy, the police, and regulatory bodies to their will, with varying degrees of success. The government led by Manmohan Singh was no exception. Its manipulation of a theoretically independent investigative agency led the Supreme Court to memorably describe the Central Bureau of Investigation as a 'caged parrot', since the ruling party had used it as an instrument to harass political opponents.
The stricture was well merited, and the BJP welcomed it gleefully. Then in opposition, it began referring to the CBI as the Congress Bureau of Investigation. But when Modi came to power, he or his government did nothing to restore the autonomy or integrity of the CBI. To the contrary, it sought to bend it to its will. Asked to bend, the CBI crawled, as witness its dropping of grave charges against senior BJP politicians. Subsequent raids on the BJP's political opponents show that, if anything, the CBI is even more eager to curry favour with the political establishment than when the Congress was in power.
Those who heard Modi's speeches in 2013-14 thought (or hoped) that he would, once in power, keep the RSS and the VHP at bay. However, those who studied Modi at work as Gujarat's chief minister were not surprised at this willed undermining of the autonomous functioning of public institutions. In Modi's Gujarat, the police and the bureaucracy were entirely subservient to the chief minister and his party. Now, as prime minister, he seeks to extend his control to the judiciary as well, as witness the attempts to take away the Supreme Court's powers to appoint judges and vest them in ruling party politicians instead.
Social pluralism and institutional autonomy are, or were intended to be, two central pillars of our republic. Both had already been rendered fragile by successive Congress governments. As these past two-and-a-half years make evident, the Modi sarkar intends to erode and corrode these pillars even further.
At the same time, the political climate has become darker and uglier ever since Modi came to power. The actions of the Manmohan Singh government were too often held hostage to cronyism, the desire to please one's friends. That was bad enough, but now vengeance, the desire to harass your critics, has replaced cronyism as the governing philosophy. The Central government's attempted suspension of NDTV India attracted criticism; far worse was the foisting, through doctored witness statements, of murder charges on some of the country's finest scholars by the Chhattisgarh government. As an editorial in The Telegraph pointed out, this was an act "tinged with a most virulent kind of malice". The "entirely unsubstantiated charges" against these scholars, the paper further commented, "are indicative of the depths of intolerance that are being charted by the present government and by all those who sail with them".
In its treatment of journalists, scholars and independent-minded citizens, Raman Singh's BJP government in Chhattisgarh has, for some time now, been a police state. When the UPA was in power at the Centre, it was too timid to question the state government's illegalities. Now, with the BJP in power at the Centre as well, the Chhattisgarh government has been given licence to further persecute its critics. Likewise, the attacks on citizens by cow vigilantes in Maharashtra and Haryana have been enabled by the fact that the BJP is in power in those states and simultaneously at the Centre.
Since he became prime minister, Modi has often argued in favour of the same party being in power in both state and Centre. He did this during the Bihar assembly elections, and shall most likely do so during the campaign for the Punjab and Uttar Pradesh elections as well. His argument is that a state will economically benefit if its ruling party is the same as that at the Centre. However, when it comes to communal harmony and civil liberties, the truth may be exactly the opposite. Back in 2002, it was a BJP government at the Centre that sought to whitewash the riots in Gujarat when the BJP was in power in the state. Now, the attacks on journalists and scholars and the harassment of minorities in states such as Chhattisgarh, Haryana and Maharashtra are encouraged, indeed enabled, by the fact that state chief ministers and other ministers know they can count on 'protection' from their party colleagues at the Centre.
The politics of vengeance, the use by the State of threats and intimidation, were always intrinsic to the 'Gujarat Model'. In the last two-and-a-half years, this model has gone national, with less than salutary effects on social life and the functioning of public institutions.
This writer shed no tears for the passing of the Congress regime. It did little to deepen democracy, and much to degrade it. It must also be said that some state governments run by regional parties (those in Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, Punjab and West Bengal, for example) combine the cronyism and corruption of the Congress culture with the spitefulness and vindictiveness of the BJP way of functioning.
Indian democracy was in less than rude health when Modi came to power in May 2014. We cannot say yet whether the prime minister's initiatives on the economic front will lead to an era of prosperity and growth, this widely shared among the citizenry. But it is already evident than when it comes to questions of individual rights and institutional integrity, the Modi sarkar is no better, and in some respects worse, than the government (or governments) that preceded it.

In all readiness
It takes all kinds of 'preparation' to brace up for demonetization. While political rivals froth at the mouth over Narendra Modi's comment about them not having had the "time to prepare" as the chief cause of their displeasure over the note ban, the Bharatiya Janata Party is taking measures to 'prepare' its legislators to survive the storm in Parliament. Six senior cabinet ministers have been told to play host to 40 BJP MPs each, ostensibly to explain the benefits of demonetization. They have apparently been told that there is a likelihood of the party president, Amit Shah, and the prime minister making surprise visits to these interactions. Since the fruits of demonetization are scheduled to be explained over meals, Rajnath Singh, Arun Jaitley, Manohar Parrikar, JP Nadda and others have to face the more immediate problem of arranging dinners in these times of cash crunch. Some of the ministers are reportedly thinking of reducing the number of dishes to be served - in some cases from a planned 32 to eight. But there is no easy answer to the question as to why these veterans should fret the same way as their angry counterparts in the Opposition. Should not they be more confident about the virtues of plastic money, especially when the Modi government is so serious about a cashless economy?
Party pooper
Demonetization has been hardest on the father of the bride. Incidentally, the Union minister for road transport and highways, Nitin Gadkari, is one of them. Apparently, he has been forced to reduce the celebrations for his daughter's upcoming wedding from six to three days. The minister had planned for a bigger guest list for the three receptions at Nagpur, Mumbai and Delhi. But following the note ban, the list too has been shortened. Media persons close to Gadkari, a breed not easily discouraged, have apparently been told that they will have their chance - to bless the couple, that is - in mid-December as a separate reception is being planned in Delhi. Another BJP leader in Maharashtra, Prakash Mehta, the state's minister for housing, is reported to have printed 25,000 wedding cards, but invited only 5,000 guests. Two leaders of the Janata parivar, who held wedding receptions for their children in the capital, were heard lamenting that many of the invitees were forced to gift coupons of e-commerce companies to the newly-weds.
Close contest
There is no let up in the thickening of the plot in poll-bound Punjab. The Congress appears to be in an upbeat mood, with the Olympian and former hockey captain, Pargat Singh, and Navjot Kaur Sidhu, the wife of the cricketer, Navjot Singh Sidhu, scheduled to join the party on November 28. While 'Captain' Amarinder Singh is leading the Congress campaign, Priyanka Gandhi has propped up former Union minister, Manish Tiwari, as the 'Hindu face' of the party. The idea seems to be that Tiwari would contest the assembly seat from Ludhiana in order to consolidate the minority Hindu votes in the state while 'Captain' brings in the Sikh votes. But a recent survey is believed to have given equal marks to the Congress, the Aam Aadmi Party and the Akalis. That could mean the Akalis hold the advantage, given that its alliance with the BJP would help it form the government.
Special evening
Every day sees more details about November 8 - the day Narendra Modi announced demonetization - tumbling out of the closet. The latest revelation has it that Modi's cabinet colleagues were discouraged from leaving the cabinet room while the PM was on air. A woman minister among them had an important engagement. But she was politely told to stay back even after Modi had finished speaking. However, another cabinet colleague, the word is that she has a weightier portfolio, was allowed to leave and then return. While the lady is certain that this was not a case of gender oversight, she cannot stop thinking about that rather odd incident.
Memory games
Mahesh Sharma, the Union culture minister, was left red-faced at a press conference organized by the New Zealand tourism ministry that was attended by the Kiwi prime minister, John Key. Sharma welcomed the premier with great warmth, but addressed him as "Prime Minister McCullum". One would have ignored the slip up had Sharma not mentioned that Narendra Modi ji was also delighted that 'Prime Minister McCullum' had come to India. But Key had the Bollywood actor, Sidharth Malhotra - New Zealand tourism's brand ambassador in India - more than make it up to him when Malhotra got up on stage to speak and failed to recall Sharma's name.
FOOTNOTE
Breaking no news



The Congress headquarters witnessed high drama recently when beat correspondents were told to rush to 24 Akbar Road for a major announcement the day Manmohan Singh spoke in Parliament. The buzz was that the announcement was regarding Rahul Gandhi finally taking over as the AICC chief. Another set speculated that it was perhaps about Priyanka Gandhi formally stepping in for the party in Uttar Pradesh. But even as the clock ticked from 8.30 pm to 9 pm and all major networks put the 'breaking news' slot on the standby, the press interaction was abruptly called off. Several theories are doing the rounds. Some feel that 10 Janpath did not want to deny Singh his place in the next day's headlines. Others believe that party veterans protested over AICC spokespersons making a big decision in their absence. There are others though who believe that Rahul or Priyanka had developed cold feet.

Cash crunch
Sir - The nation was shocked by the decision of the prime minister, Narendra Modi, to demonetize banknotes in the denominations of 500 and 1,000 ("Abolished: Rs 500 and Rs 1000 notes", Nov 9). The good intentions of the government notwithstanding, common people have been thoroughly inconvenienced by this move. There is panic at petrol pumps and ATMs. Not only are customers facing problems while purchasing items of daily use, but small-time vendors, grocers and retail businessmen are also feeling hassled.
The government should have thought in practical terms before taking such a step. It should have kept in mind the fact that this is the season of festivities and weddings. Banks had reportedly been advised to stock ATMs with notes of smaller denominations in advance. Yet people were getting 500-rupee notes from ATMs even a few hours before the announcement was made.
However, it is laudable that people have been given enough time to deposit the invalid banknotes in their accounts. Indians have reposed their faith in Modi. One hopes that his efforts to get rid of fake currency and black money would not go to waste.
Yours faithfully, S. Balakrishnan,  Jamshedpur
Sir - It is anybody's guess whether the demonetization of 500- and 1,000-rupee notes will actually stop the circulation of black money. But it is important to consider the harassment that common people are facing everyday. For instance, the stipulation that hospitals would accept the devalued notes does not apply to private medical centres. Everybody knows that government hospitals in India are in an appaling state - they are understaffed and ill-equipped. Most people have to go to private hospitals if they want proper treatment.
It was heart-rending to read about patients who had been refused treatment by private hospitals. The government should have made it mandatory for all hospitals to accept the demonetized currency notes. Hospitals are supposed to have valid bank accounts - they cannot be facing problems in getting the notes exchanged. Private hospitals and doctors are likely to use this opportunity to charge random sums for treatment. The Central government and the Reserve Bank of India should have considered all possible fall outs before implementing such a big decision.
Yours faithfully, S.K. Choudhury, Bangalore
Sir - The step to demonetize two high-denomination banknotes has provided a great boost to the e-commerce sector. It is likely to take India closer to the possibility of becoming a cashless economy in the future and fulfil the dream of Digital India. The government should be congratulated for catching hoarders of black money unawares. Even if the measure does not completely solve the problem of corruption in India, it undoubtedly amounts to the first brick in the wall.
Yours faithfully, Akash Kumar,  Jagraon, Punjab
Sir - According to a press conference held by the RBI, there were about 16.5 billion 500-rupee notes and 6.7 billion 1,000-rupee notes in circulation when these denominations were demonetized. I was shocked to learn that the RBI plans to shred the currency notes that are no longer legal tender. It is a criminal waste of paper, which was made after cutting down numerous trees. After the demonetization, there were also reports of people burning wads of cash that they could not deposit. The smoke from this added to the already dangerous levels of air pollution in the country.
The central bank must find a way to reuse or recycle the invalid currency notes. There is no point in signing agreements on climate change if we keep felling trees and causing air pollution. The Bank of England recycles useless currency notes by composting them and using them as soil fertilizers. The RBI should think along similar lines.
Yours faithfully, Adrija Chakraborty, Calcutta
Sir - Most Indians have welcomed the recent demonetization move of the Narendra Modi government. Politicians who are protesting against it have probably hoarded black money, which will now go to waste. The problems being caused by the demonetization drive are short-lived. Politicians who are complaining about the difficulties being faced by ordinary people should think about the inconvenience they cause by calling bandhs. My grandson could not appear in an entrance examination because of a bandh. The annoyance of the ruling dispensation in West Bengal is obvious. Perhaps the allegation that its ministers have illegal money from chit funds is true after all.
Yours faithfully, Nirupam Haldar, Calcutta
Sir - The decision of the government to demonetize banknotes of the denominations of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 was hasty. Sitaram Yechury, the general secretary of the Communist Party of India (Marxist), has rightly compared the move to an act of cleaning a pond to kill crocodiles that ends up eliminating the small fish instead.
Images of the new Rs 2,000 banknote have been doing the rounds in the social media for quite some time now. This suggests that the news of demonetization was not as well-guarded a secret as the government makes it out to be.
The people worst affected by the government's decision are middle-class, salaried individuals. Those with black money also have the resources to escape the scrutiny of the income-tax department.
Yours faithfully, Aditya Bannerjee,  Gurgaon

The going gets tough
Sir - The usually reticent former prime minister, Manmohan Singh, delivering a resolute speech in the Rajya Sabha on demonetization was a rare sight ("Manmohan's missile", Nov 25). Singh declared that the government had made a "monumental management failure" in the implementation of demonetization, and called the move an "organized loot and legalized plunder of the common people". He took to task the prime minister's office, the finance minister's office and the Reserve Bank of India.
It was evident that Singh's opinions stemmed from his experience as an economist and as a former Union finance minister and governor of the RBI. Even though Singh belongs to the Congress, his talk was devoid of political rhetoric. He focused clearly on the economic fallouts of demonetization. The prime minister, Narendra Modi, was reckless in executing the demonetization drive without having first made adequate preparations to meet its consequences. As a result of demonetization, ordinary citizens are facing formidable challenges. The economy, too, has slowed down. Modi would do well to pay heed to Singh's advice and act swiftly to remedy the rapidly deteriorating situation.
Yours faithfully, S.K. Choudhury, Bangalore
Sir - Manmohan Singh was unequivocal in his criticism of the manner in which demonetization was implemented. He highlighted the misery of the people. However, he remained silent about other measures the government could have taken. It is not possible that the prime minister did not consult economists before taking such a big step. Did they really make a miscalculation as big as Singh suggested?
If Singh's predictions do come true, there will be no end to India's despair. Most people will not make any tangible gains from demonetization, but they put up with the difficulties in the hope of experiencing the promised achchhe din. Singh's apprehensions have now put them in a quandary.
Yours faithfully, Ashok Chakrabarty, Calcutta
Sir - Much has been said recently about the former prime minister, Manmohan Singh, and his successor, Narendra Modi, in the context of demonetization. However, the truth is that the actions of both are politically motivated. In India, politicians seldom pay any heed to the middle class. They pretend to take care of the poor while actually helping the rich. It is the middle and salaried class that quietly puts up with the repercussions of the plans implemented by the government. Most people from this section of society have basic education, and are able to tell right from wrong. They usually do not believe the false promises made by political parties.
Owing to their disillusionment with politicians, middle-class citizens have stopped exercising their voting rights usefully. But now is the time for them to wake up and start voicing their opinions.
Yours faithfully, Shivang Agarwal, Calcutta
Young victims
Sir - It was shocking to learn that newborn babies were found in a biscuit carton for the purpose of smuggling ("Pandora's box", Nov 25). Investigators from the Criminal Investigation Department have rescued more than 10 babies, and found the remains of two others who had been buried. It is suspected that many more babies may have been sold in the past few years. The racket is believed to have originated in Baduria in North 24 Parganas before spreading its tentacles across the state. In a cruel paradox, the ruling party regularly introduces schemes for the benefit of children, especially girls.
According to a National Crime Records Bureau report, West Bengal ranks second in the list of states with the highest number of cases of human trafficking. The government, too busy indulging in petty politics, was oblivious of this nefarious trade in West Bengal. It should now ensure that the culprits get the strictest punishment.
In my hometown, Bardhaman, there are many small healthcare facilities that do not even have basic amenities. The government should monitor such institutions to ensure that illegal activities are not carried out there. It should also employ more trained people under the Integrated Child Development Scheme. They can be intermediaries between the government and healthcare institutions.
Yours faithfully, Subhankar Mukherjee, Calcutta
Sir - Dubious healthcare outlets have mushroomed all over the city. These places are not interested in providing proper medical help to people; they are, instead, hubs of criminal activities. In a recent case, vulnerable women were either duped into giving up their babies for measly sums of money, or were told that their babies were still-born. The smuggled babies were then sold for large amounts of money to affluent people. The ruling party was too busy protesting against the Centre's actions to pay attention to its own state.
Yours faithfully, N.K. Das Gupta, Calcutta

Magic wand
â¢ Sir - The plight of the septuagenarian author, Chitra Deb, in the aftermath of demonetization, would resonate with the millions who have been suffering similarly from November 8, when the prime minister, Narendra Modi, suddenly announced that high-denomination currency notes would be withdrawn ("How the crunch broke me", Dec 2). People are enduring much hardship, which is combined with the indignity of having to beg for one's own hard-owned money from banks. And all this is to satisfy the whims of a prime minister who thought that waving the magic wand of demonetization would exorcise the demons of black money overnight.
In all these weeks, the economy must have suffered a lot as a result of the loss of productive man hours and the crippling of small-scale industries. Initially, ministers at the Centre were saying that the aim of demonetization is to eliminate black money. After the chaos occasioned by the demonetization drive, the government changed its tack and is now saying that the purpose is to make India a cashless economy. In reality, it is becoming a less-cash economy.
Cashless transactions are made through debit or credit cards. A large percentage of the people of the country do not possess such cards. Another method is to use mobile applications like PayPM, sorry, Paytm, which usually require smartphones with internet connection. Only a tiny fraction of people possess smartphones.
We are very far from having the infrastructure that is necessary for making the country go cashless. The demonetization drive is probably just a political stunt, which has been performed with an eye on the upcoming elections in major states. People are supporting it because they have been told that the filthy rich, who hoard black money, would be punished. As the story unfolds, it is evident that it is the common man who has suffered the most. The government has warned people against the misuse of Jan Dhan bank accounts. People having these accounts usually belong to the disadvantaged sections of society. They will be harassed by the authorities.
The sheer size of the task defies imagination. Surely, there are many Vijay Mallyas in the country? The government can probably achieve much more if it trains its guns on such people.
Yours faithfully,
Vinod Mody, Calcutta
 
â¢ Sir - Through the demonetization and ancillary schemes, the government has succeeded in making transactions cashless, women gold-less and, indirectly, society senior citizen-less. The last achievement is noteworthy. After all, elderly people are not of much use. They are abandoned by their children when the latter grow up. They are a burden on society and create a negative impact on the growth of the gross domestic product. So, the attempt to liquidate them by restricting their access to cash is a laudable endeavour of the government.
Yours faithfully,
Sanjit Ghatak, Narendrapur
 
â¢ Sir - It was painful to read about the problems faced by Chitra Deb. All of us have been inconvenienced by the government's plan to demonetize. But people are not protesting much - they believe that the government is doing something for the betterment of the country. Deb does not use a mobile phone or a personal computer. This is her choice. But for the sake of good governance, if we need to adopt a new system, we should be ready to do that.
 
Yours faithfully,
Soma Ojha, Calcutta
 
â¢ Sir - I have started hating the prime minister for punishing citizens like me. I do not stand in queues to buy tickets for games or celebrity shows. I have type 2 diabetes and spend most of my waking hours doing household chores, listening to old music, watching news and meditating. The Union government has cited a number of reasons in support of its decision. Supposedly, it is fighting corruption, bribery and terrorism. Could the government not find other methods to realize its aims? The government has found an easy target in people like us, who are dependent on the earnings from our savings.
 
Yours faithfully,
Arunima Saha, Calcutta
 
Entry permit
â¢ Sir - Although the Constitution guarantees equality for all, equality is not a lived experience here. The day on which women were allowed to enter the Haji Ali Dargahwas a significant one. Women had been prevented from stepping into the inner sanctum of Haji Ali for no good reason. After the judiciary lifted the ban, the authorities agreed to let women in. Certain issues still remain unresolved. The victory may seem to have been undercut by the restrictions placed on visitors' entry. But the fact that the dargah has been opened up for women is more important than the constraints. Hopefully, the Sabarimala temple would also open its doors to women of all ages.
Yours faithfully,

One of the documents released by the Congress that purportedly shows the BJP buying land in Bihar in the months before demonetisation


New Delhi/Patna, Nov. 25: The Congress today said the layers of the "biggest scam" - the demonetisation decision, according to the party - had begun to unravel with the disclosure that the BJP went on a land-purchase spree in several districts of Bihar before the note ban decision was announced on November 8.
The land, the BJP says, was purchased for district party offices. Senior leader Sushil Kumar Modi said the decision to have its own office in all districts of India was taken by the BJP's central leadership in 2014. "Purchase of land for the same is a process in this direction. Unlike the Congress, we don't have our own office in Patna," he said.
In New Delhi, Congress communications chief Randeep Surjewala said: "The BJP purchased land worth hundreds of crores in different parts of the country just before the demonetisation decision. Payments were made through cash as well as cheque. There is proof of land deals worth Rs 3.41 crore in Bihar only. This has been done in most states. There can't be a better way of transforming black money into white than investments in real estate."
Surjewala produced copies of sale deeds and registration papers as proof of his allegations. A news portal had also reported about the land deals in Bihar. Rahul Gandhi pasted a link of that exposé on his Twitter handle along with an acerbic remark: "Fully prepared for demonetization."
The Opposition parties have been alleging that the BJP and some "corporate friends" of the Prime Minister were tipped off and they had made arrangements in advance. Surjewala said today: "The country saw how the Bengal BJP deposited Rs 3 crore just before the decision. Now the land deal in Bihar. The layers have begun to unravel."
In Patna, the JDU said the BJP purchased land worth over Rs 4 crore at government circle rates in Bihar when the actual market rate was much higher. The party has demanded a probe into the land purchase by a judicial committee to find out if black money was used in the purchase.
BJP's member of the Bihar Legislative Council Lalbabu Prasad, one of the three party leaders who is a signatory in the purchase of land, denied involvement of black money.
"We have purchased the land for opening party offices at government rates. In Bihar, the government rate is higher than the actual market rate," Prasad said.
"There is no question of giving additional black money to the land owner. The money has been transferred to landowners through RTGS system and the money came from the party headquarters," Prasad told The Telegraph, insisting that he, along with party leaders Sanjeev Chaurasia and Dilip Jaiswal, was authorised by the state BJP leadership to sign the legal documents. "Whoever among us was free used to go and sign the documents," he said.
BJP MLA Chaurasia said the amount paid to land owners was based on government rates. "Everything is in the public domain. If the JDU alleges that we have purchased the land with black money, let them investigate and prove it. They run the government in Bihar," he said.
Sushil Modi said every purchase was accounted for. "These were not illegal purchases. Every paisa is accounted for and has been paid through banks. We will submit the accounts to the income tax department and the Election Commission. Not to the JDU."
In Delhi, Surjewala detailed the BJP purchases. "The first registration of land for Rs 60.13 lakh in the name of the BJP national president and executed through Sanjeev Chaurasia was done in Lakhisarai on September 6. The second for Rs 85.15 lakh in the name of Dilip Kumar Jaiswal of 11 Ashoka Road, the BJP's headquarters in Delhi, was done on September 16 in Katihar. Jaiswal is the BJP's treasurer. Again another piece of land in Katihar (was purchased) on the same date for Rs 41.48 lakh in Jaiswal's name."
Surjewala added: "Then on September 19, land worth Rs 25.07 lakh in Arwal in the name of 11 Ashoka Road, Delhi. Another deal of Rs 39 lakh in Kishanganj on the same date in the name of Amit Shah. On September 19, one more piece of land in Arwal worth Rs 80 lakh. In October, land worth Rs 73.5 lakh was bought in Madhubani too. It is clear the BJP was desperately looking for avenues to turn its black money into white. We demand the BJP makes all its recent deals public and explain where this money came from."
In Patna, the JDU said much the same. "The BJP should come out with facts and figures from where they got the money and name the donors who donated more than Rs 20,000," JDU spokesperson Sanjay Singh said at a press meet in the Bihar capital on Friday.

The year 2016 taught us that the world is an unpredictable place and credentialed, data-driven expert opinion isn't a reliable guide to its politics. Whether we can draw larger conclusions about disciplinary expertise from the marquee events of this awful year is an open question. We are told by pollsters that psephology isn't an exact science. Nate Silver, for example, spent a lot of time after Trump's win explaining why FiveThirtyEight hadn't really botched its presidential election forecast. He pointed to the FiveThirtyEight analysis that had suggested that Trump was likelier than Hillary to win the election without winning the popular vote. The post-election pollster defence was that readers often mistook the two or three per cent advantage ascribed to Hillary Clinton for a decisive lead, when it was actually closer to the outcome of a coin toss.
Brexit was similar though not quite the same. While there was a narrow consensus that the 'Remainers' would win, the polling had shown the 'Leavers' ahead a few times and there was real unease amongst the 'Remainers' even if they weren't always willing to acknowledge it. Still, the fact that Nigel Farage appeared to concede the referendum before the counting started suggested that the balance of probabilities favoured the Remainers. We know how that panned out.
The other lesson of 2016 was that moral outrage is a poor guide to the future. One reason why the media consensus shifted in favour of Remain was the murder of Jo Cox days before the European Union referendum. Her murderer, Thomas Mair, was associated with extreme right-wing organizations and was reported to have shouted 'Britain First' before killing her. The revulsion against this barbaric political murder helped people believe that a majority of Britons couldn't vote for a cause that harboured terrorists like Mair. They were wrong; there were legitimate grounds for voting to leave and 'Leavers', reasonably, refused to feel any guilt by association.
More generally, the fact that a cheerful xenophobe like Nigel Farage was the spearhead of the move to leave the EU, persuaded many opinion makers and public figures, including a large chunk of the Tory establishment, that the chance of a majority of Britons supporting a maverick's crazy scheme was vanishingly small. Expert mainstream notions of what was politically respectable, sensible and likely were poor guides to electoral outcomes because the Right managed to create its own common sense, by seamlessly melding economic resentment and aspiration with nativist nationalism.
Similarly, Donald Trump's bizarre candidacy, specially his willingness to take the tropes of the extreme Right into national politics so horrified the commentariat that Republican legislators, governors, even op-ed pillars of the American Right like David Frum, David Brooks, Ross Douthat, Charles Krauthammer and George Will backed away from endorsing him. A large part of this unwillingness to endorse him was predicated on the assumption that he would lose, that public figures tainted by their support for this lecherous, racist buffoon would pay a price after the inevitable electoral debacle. (One of the rare pleasures of post-election America is the sight of conservative pundits crab-walking their way towards Trumpian normalcy.)
But only one part of the disapproval of Brexit and Trump was based on their lack of respectability and virtue. The other determining factor was that mainstream economic opinion insisted that leaving the EU and abandoning treaties like the North American Free Trade Agreement and the Trans-Pacific Partnership would have dire economic consequences. At least in the short term these forecasts have come to little or nothing. The chief economist of the Bank of England has just apologized for the central bank's gloomy prophecies. Paul Krugman, to his credit, consistently criticized economists who predicted economic disaster in the short-term post-Brexit, though this didn't stop him from feverishly forecasting doom the day of Trump's triumph, only to reverse himself the next day. Trump's economic illiteracy doesn't seem to have depressed market sentiment in the United States of America; if anything the corporate world seems bullish at the prospect of tax cuts, deregulation and infrastructure spending.
The point is not that Trump or the Brexiteers were right; it is that after the great recession of 2007, and after the more recent chargrilling of Greece by the IMF and the EU, the credibility of economists and the institutions they ran or counselled, was publicly diminished. Trump and Brexit happened at least in part because not enough people were frightened by the bogeys waved by experts who considered themselves economically literate. Simon Jenkins recently disparaged the expertise of economists. Referring to the failure of the profession to anticipate the disaster of 2008, he wrote: "Economics is plagued by the spurious exactness of mathematics. It neglects human behaviour and grovels before its paymasters in government and commerce. Its forecasting is as much use as Mystic Meg and the astrologers. Predicting economic disaster may not be as crucial as predicting war, but its consequences can be massive. The essence of any science is relentless self-criticism. Economics should suffer what the intelligence community did after Iraq. It should be asked, in public, to explain how it came to make so blatant a professional error."
The inability or unwillingness of economists to answer questions of enormous public importance such as the consequences of demonetization raises difficult questions about the relevance of the discipline to policy and opinion. Kenneth Rogoff, who literally wrote the book on the subject, wrote a post on his publisher's blog which distanced his prescription for the gradual demonetizing of large denomination notes in the US from Modi's sudden-death strike, while carefully hedging his bets on whether it was a good thing. Much, he said, would depend on the implementation. In the short term, he intoned, there would be a cost to pay but in the long term it might benefit the economy. You could programme a bot to say the same for any economic policy or event; why pay an economist?
One reason why economists critical of demonetization were forced to hedge their bets was because the sort of public anger that ought to accompany extreme economic difficulty wasn't evident. Either Indians were, in the manner of orientals, uniquely long-suffering or they were, again in a manner peculiar to desis, so delighted at the alleged losses of those better off than them that schadenfreude made up for their own distress. Or perhaps their faith in the prime minister's integrity prompted them to give him the benefit of the doubt for as long as it took.
Each one of these speculations/ explanations call into question materialist assumptions about human behaviour, assumptions that are fundamental to both economics as a discipline and our common sense understanding of the world around us. Looking back at 2016, it's hard to believe that either of these have survived the events of this last year, intact.

Garrulity has its uses. It creates a blur of sound and generates a fog of puzzlement. The prime minister, Narendra Modi, has turned garrulity into a political instrument that is used to distract his audience. After the usual high hopes about the possible gems of wisdom the prime minister might strew around in his eve-of-the-new-year speech, the gawping Indian populace was served with a peroration masterly in its evasion of the single question of the day. Mr Modi had promised 50 days of pain after the announcement of demonetization, at which point he would - thus his rhetoric suggested - either deliver the India of people's dreams or accept any punishment that they ordained for him. His high-melodrama style made his promise that he would 'cleanse' India of black money in 50 days seem credible. He was honestly inviting all 'good' Indians to 'suffer' for the sake of the greater good of the country. Indians believe in the fruits of suffering; this quasi-spiritual, quasi-patriotic logic appealed to them.
But after the 50 days, on the last day of 2016, the prime minister said precisely nothing. He was silent about reaching the target of demonetization - or not, about whether, in a fit of prime ministerial whimsy or nervousness, the target had become a cashless economy and what was being done to make it possible, about how much longer people's rights to draw their own money were to be violated and when the promised amounts were to appear in the Jan Dhan accounts, about whether the time had come to 'punish' him and if not, why not. But he was not really silent; he talked his way past the legs of the elephant in the room. He announced financial schemes to ease home loans for the poor and the middle-class, help the farmer and small and medium enterprises, senior citizens and pregnant women. Not that the last is a new scheme anyway. Pitched as palliatives for the 'pain', these are sops that can only have a political agenda. Demonetization had been preceded by barely disguised political campaigns for nationalism and majoritarianism that did not, perhaps, promise continued political ascendancy. An expert in divisive tactics, Mr Modi had based his demonetization, too, on a simple rich-poor divide. Maybe that is looking shaky too. Hence a spouting of promises that would better fit the finance minister's speech to come. As long as there is garrulity, there is salvation.

There is an elementary piece of economic truth that remains unshaken since time immemorial. Put simply, it runs: "Nothing comes from nothing." Or, using economic jargon, there is a price to be paid to ensure any outcome that generates comfort. At the level of the individual, a decent dinner calls for a payment. At the level of society, weeding out black money from the system calls for hardships as well. To be borne by millions of innocent common men and women queueing up in front of ATM kiosks to withdraw measly sums of cash to try and satisfy their demand for daily essentials. According to reports, the hardship has been somewhat extreme, for one person at least is said to have collapsed as he waited for his Rs 2,000. And died, as non-resident Indians sitting in Japan were clapping and giggling away in vulgar merriment that the motherland they never intend to return to was being cleansed.
Quite obviously, the shortage of cash in the pockets of the unlucky ones living in India will ensure that they restrict their expenditure to commodities that are truly necessities. Since creating a shortage of currency in the economy was never known to be an antidote to profane corruption, essential commodities can well disappear for a while from the markets, hand in hand with dirty money. The example that comes readily to mind is the case of common salt. The price of salt soared for no obvious reason from about Rs 12 to Rs 300 per kilogram, if the news channels are to be trusted. In spite of claims to the contrary, in some areas of the country at least, salt appears to have turned into the scarcest of commodities. When an essential commodity turns scarce relative to the demand for it, people need to spend more to acquire it, and the spending in the present instance is taking the form of toilsomely acquired cash, recognized white cash, that is turning instantaneously into black money.
This of course is the least important of examples of the re-emergence of black money even as the common man is bearing the labour pains necessary to deliver a clean India. A new class of middlemen has sprung up that, according to reports, is exchanging bad money for good by charging a premium. How they are managing to get rid of the bad money they are accumulating is for the law keepers to figure out. However, there were at least two persons who were interviewed by television channels, one located in Delhi and the other in Mathura, who claimed to be ready to perform, and openly so. One of them was ready to give coins in exchange, quite independently of the total sum of money being offered. Hence, one probably hears further that Rs 10 coins too now stand banned. These individuals could well have been bluffing of course. However, given that the formal banking system is yet to penetrate vast areas of the country, one can easily guess the nature of happenings right now beyond the boundaries of the metropolitan areas.
Powerful moneylenders have not disappeared from our rural economy. Nor have poor farmers and landless labourers. These latter groups of people are doubtlessly being charged steep rates of interest for the white money they are borrowing to sustain their hand-to-mouth existence. Classroom economics, too, teaches us that interest rates rise with a fall in money supply relative to demand, although the channel through which the rise comes about is quite different.
The immediate impact of stripping Rs 500 and Rs 1000 notes of their legal tender status is a fall in the money supply. This results in the existing money demand as a whole (that is, demand for currency plus money in the form of bank deposits) exceeding the new money supply (that is, the sum total of bank deposits and the reduced currency supply). Textbook logic tells us that the excess demand for money leads to a sale of interest bearing financial assets in search of non-interest bearing money required to carry out daily transactions. The rush to sell off such paper assets leads to a fall in their prices relative to the face value of their nominal returns. This works out into a rise in interest rates. Whichever way we look at it then, interest rates in general are likely to go up in the near future when the business sector, backed by the government, has been clamouring for lower interest rates. Ironically enough, we are told that Raghuram Rajan refused to serve a second term as governor of the Reserve Bank of India on account of his disagreement with the government over the very same interest rate issue. He was not in favour of low interest rates, given his concern about inflation.
Higher interest rates can cause a fall in the demand for loans to purchase durable consumer goods, thus slowing down the manufacturing sector. This will also reduce the demand for loans on the part of the manufacturers to purchase raw materials. In turn, this will weaken the demand for transport services required to deliver finished or semi-finished products and reduce along with it the incomes of daily wage earners in that sector.
There is yet another route through which such transport services can be affected, and this is not linked to interest rates. Given the telltale signals that the problem surrounding the shortage of currency is not about to disappear soon, many of the markets where cash transactions dominate will come to a standstill. In such markets, neither will the grocers be able to sell, nor buyers be able to buy. Consequently, business activities will dry up in the short run, which in turn will affect the transporters to these markets.
The price, then, is being paid and will continue to be paid till the cash supply turns normal in the economy. Normalcy, though, does not mean smoothly working ATMs alone. Let us recall that that a huge chunk of money has been banned from the system. Presumably the RBI will increase the money supply back to where it was before demonetization through repo rate reductions, open market operations and so on. The interest rate will fall again perhaps, but as most commentators have noted, this by itself is unlikely to eradicate corruption.
Instead it could well turn out to be a story of new black money driving out old black money. If demonetization turns out to be the chosen tool for getting rid of black money, then the policy has to be repeated over time. Perhaps this is what the government has in mind, going by the announcement heard from Japan. More is in store, we were told, beyond December 31. In the meantime though, the growth rate of the economy might fall during the second quarter. Combined with the first quarter low growth rate, the annual growth rate is almost certain to be lower than projected. And we have no clue at all about the inflation scenario that might emerge.
Robert Lucas, Nobel laureate and a founder of the rational expectations school of thought, had an important piece of advice for governments engaged with monetary policy. He believed, on the basis of his theory, that monetary policy was not likely to have any perceptible impact on an economy unless it took the shape of random shocks that caught the populace unawares. However, repeated random shocks, even if they produced the intended results in the immediate future, were likely to destabilize the economy and result in unwarranted economic cycles.
Perhaps the government of India has a lesson to learn from Lucas and should stop gloating over the shock therapies it is planning for the nation. A price is being paid right now, but one cannot fool all men for all time.
The economy had better improve in the not-too-distant future.

Cities, like dreams, are made of desires and fears, even if the thread of their discourse is secret, their rules are absurd, their perspectives deceitful, and everything conceals something else. - ITALO CALVINO
 **************************************************






Brexit and Donald Trump produced election results this year that flummoxed political and diplomatic circles throughout the world. But this was not the only occasion. In May 2014, most foreign embassies in New Delhi were quite surprised and occasionally at a loss for words at the scale of Narendra Modi's electoral victory. They had factored in a possible Congress setback and even the Bharatiya Janata Party leading a coalition government, but an outright majority for Modi was never factored in.
The outcome, quite predictably, led to a panicky reaction since most embassies had depended on their usual English-speaking media contacts for insights. Only a few Asian countries had even bothered to develop independent connections with a man who had been chief minister of Gujarat for the past 13 years. One embassy of a very important country tried to retrieve the situation by facilitating visits by retired diplomats who had served during the term of Atal Bihari Vajpayee between 1998 and 2004. The assumption was that those who had developed friendships during the previous National Democratic Alliance administration would be in a better position to understand and anticipate the Modi agenda.
I am not privy to the reports these India hands wrote for their foreign ministry desks. However, I suspect that their insights into how the Vajpayee government operated 10 years ago helped very little in attempting to come to grips with either the style or the political philosophy of the new prime minister.
The reality that Modi is blessed with a distinctive approach has gradually seeped into the consciousness of the political punditry over the past 30 months. Yet, despite this awareness, there is a high level of cluelessness over what exactly to expect.
Part of this uncertainty stems from the fact that Modi is probably one of the few politicians who is a loner. Unlike most politicians, he is disinclined to nurturing a durbar that invariably has a large share of hangers-on. The prime minister operates with a very lean personal office that includes people who are not inclined to run a proverbial 'private practice'. On top of that, Modi himself is no socializer. He keeps his attendance at social functions to a bare minimum and most of his interactions are work related. Consequently, the tradition of fixers and intermediaries who could be trusted to bend the leader's ears and intercede on behalf of someone has been put on hold. Modi always had a certain wariness of the cosy culture of Lutyens's Delhi and on moving into Race Course Road (now renamed Lok Kalyan Marg) he has put it into practice, much to the consternation of the ancien régime that feels dispossessed on political power and influence.
Take the decision on demonetization as an example. For the first few days after the November 8 announcement, a section of the Opposition convinced itself that some people had prior information of the decision. In Parliament, the Congress and the Trinamul Congress demanded a joint parliamentary committee to probe into suspicions of insider trading. The former prime minister, Manmohan Singh, couched his indictment of the economic logic of demonetization with the grave charge that the country witnessed "organized loot and legalized plunder". On his part, the Congress vice president has competed with the Delhi and West Bengal chief ministers in levelling unsubstantiated charges of cronyism.
At one level, these charges of insider trading are part of the culture of hurling insults and calling your opponent a thief. Those levelling the charges may not even be convinced of their veracity. However, at another level, there is a huge surprise, bordering on absolute disbelief, that a decision of this enormous magnitude could be kept secret in an otherwise porous Indian system. The question as to who exactly knew before November 8 has become a subject of intense speculation. In the Rajya Sabha, the loquacious Samajwadi Party MP, Naresh Agrawal, suggested that the finance minister, Arun Jaitley, could surely not have known about the exercise prior to the late-evening broadcast because he is apparently incapable of keeping a secret. The observation was greeted with some amusement but there was a larger point. Whether it is to do with the post-Uri surgical strikes against Pakistan or the demonetization announcement, Modi has displayed his ability to motivate his ministers and officials to rise to the occasion. He has succeeded in creating a culture of purposefulness and commanding leadership. It is not that every decision is a command from the top - Modi revels in a focussed discussion and is not afraid to take one step backwards - but that his ministerial team has moulded themselves to fit the new style of leadership.
The unquestioned dominance of Modi in a party that has traditionally favoured a collegiate style has prompted speculation over a possible rift with either the party or the larger Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh parivar. In the first months of the Modi government, when the focus was on political appointments and the so-called "intolerance" assaulting Constitutional values, there were facile suggestions of the RSS being the real masters of India. Curiously, at the half-way point of the government these accusations have yielded place to the theory that Modi's imperiousness will create strains between the party and the government, just as it did between Vajpayee and the RSS. This is the opening that Modi's political opponents are desperately looking for.
There is always scope for friction between those who run the government and those entrusted with running the party. What is remarkable is how little evidence there is of the government and the party being out of step. Some of this can be attributed to the tact and nimble-footedness of the BJP president, Amit Shah, and the RSS chief, Mohanrao Bhagwat. Both seem to have imbibed the larger lessons of the tensions that existed between the sangh parivar and Vajpayee's PMO. On its part, the RSS has desisted from the micro-management that the former RSS chief, K.S. Sudarshan, attempted, particularly on appointments and policies. And Amit Shah has ensured that the party is sufficiently focussed on immediate issues to desist from the gossipy and dalali culture that often plagues political organizations when the focus shifts to governance. Indeed, what Modi appears to have done is to leave the entire business of political management almost entirely to the party. This may explain why internal opposition to demonetization - particularly from the section in the party most adversely affected by it - was so muted.
This delegation to trusted colleagues has always been a hallmark of Modi. During the 2014 election campaign, for example, Modi detached himself almost completely from the selection of candidates. He focussed single-mindedly on the campaign and to some extent, the publicity. Modi has often been unfairly accused of centralizing all power in his office. The reality suggests that, apart from patronage where he was extremely anxious to prevent misuse, there has been a huge delegation of authority to ministers and party functionaries. However, there is a fanatical insistence on accountability.
As he completes his half-way mark of the present term, Modi has altered the political landscape more profoundly than what people initially imagined. Some of the changes reflect the single-minded, work-oriented and austere personality of the man himself. However, there is a larger orientation. Modi does not believe that the mandate he secured from the electorate in May 2014 was merely to 'manage' the country. He sees himself as an agent of a fundamental transformation. And in this missionary zeal, he is guided above all by his foremost inspiration - Swami Vivekananda.

A Central Intelligence Agency official posted here in the late Eighties used to say India's criminals were a step ahead of his government. They immediately replicated every new security feature the United States of America incorporated in its visas. I wonder how long it will be before they also forge the promised 2000- and 500-rupee notes which will then finance terrorists, subvert the economy and be hoarded as black money until the next tectonic purge.
This is not to trash Narendra Modi's intention. But the drama of an operation which regards black money as a secret hoard instead of a way of operating, and assumes that 86 per cent of the money in circulation is tainted, can become a dazzling political end in itself. It must be asked if an exercise bearing all the marks of haste and ill-preparedness that has ground the economy to a halt, plunged the country into frenzied chaos and inflicted suffering on millions of people is the right instrument aimed at the appropriate people to deliver the long-term hope of a less unequal society. The Oxfam report, An Economy for the 1%, conveyed the iniquitous message that 62 individuals now own as much wealth as half of humanity or 320 crore people. The wealth of the richest 62 persons has increased by more than half a trillion dollars to $1.76 trillion since 2010 while the wealth of the poorest half of the global population has fallen by 38 per cent or a trillion dollars.
India doesn't lag behind in inequity. Liberalization aggravated the distortions of socialism so that, thanks to corrupt ministers and bureaucrats on the take, a tiny minority of corporate fat cats batten on the country's resources and call the political tune. India's 100 richest people have more money than two-thirds of the population put together. According to Wealth-X, the global leader in providing intelligence on wealth, the top five business houses accounted for 47.5 per cent ($85.5 billion) of the total $180 billion held by 103 Indian billionaires in 2014. Forbes listed only 65 billionaires in 2013 and 61 the previous year. So, the number of billionaires (and we are talking US dollars, not the despised demonetized rupee) is growing if nothing else in India is.
Two years ago, Wealth-X identified the Big Five as Mukesh Ambani, Lakshmi Mittal, Dilip Shanghvi, Azim Premji and Pallonji Shapoorji Mistry. Give or take a few billion dollars here or there, add Shiv Nadar, Kumar Mangalam Birla, Adi Godrej and Shashi and Ravi Ruia and you have a fuller picture. Whether Dhirubhai Ambani would have called them the "right" or the "wrong" people, the sheer mass of their wealth must necessarily include the bulk of the supposedly black money in circulation. How have these 10 financial stalwarts and pillars of economic prowess responded to demonetization? Have they hailed it as a brilliant measure that will cleanse the system, thwart mischievous Pakistanis, and put an end to Islamic terrorism, Kashmiri separatism, Maoist rebellion and various ethnic insurgencies lingering on in the Northeast? Have they expunged their own treasuries of impugned money? Delhi may be buzzing with rumours but I haven't seen any reports either of their liquidity being affected or any comment by these movers and shakers of Indian life in the public domain.
It's usual during national crises for the leaders of civil society - which must include captains of industry - to express their views. The government has every right to expect them to speak out. Instead of only baying for the blood of the absent Vijay Mallya and Lalit Modi, Opposition politicians should also demand that the richest in the land declare themselves. Instead, we have a deafening silence. It's only because of this absence of transparency that a Bharatiya Janata Party legislator can be charged - possibly quite unfairly - with saying, " Adani, Ambani atram-satram in sab ko pehle hi pata thha. Inko hint de diya gaya. Unhone apna kar liya (Adani, Ambani and others knew it beforehand. They had been given a hint and they made arrangements accordingly)." Such suspicions are inevitable in a situation where taxation is high but erratic while political spending is lavish and utterly opaque. Nicholas Kaldor's advice to Jawaharlal Nehru of a maximum tax rate of 15 per cent with much wider and far more effective collection merits revisiting. So do repeated commitments regarding election funding.
The 2014 Lok Sabha election was the most expensive so far. Although a candidate's permitted spending limit was yanked up from Rs 40 lakh to Rs 70 lakh, the Centre for Media Studies claimed that "unaccounted for" money pumped in by "crorepati" candidates, corporates and contractors further pushed up costs. Demonetization would have appeared more justified if political expenses had been listed with counterfeit money, terrorist funding, Pakistani sabotage and tax evasion as a reason for the sudden swoop. But that is asking for the moon. It remains as true today as when Atal Bihari Vajpayee first said it, that every legislator in this country starts his legislative career with the lie of the false election return he submits.
As a State Bank of India banker said at a recent investor's meet organized by a commercial bank, tax evasion is in our DNA. Black money will never be completely eradicated. But the amount might become manageable if India studies the American, German and Australian systems so that the politician-financier nexus is subject to public scrutiny. As Britain's late Robin Cook put it, "[T]he danger to democracy of secret donations is that they put public government under private obligation." Calcutta's blue and white pavement railings, often inconveniencing pedestrians, and the cheap showiness of fairy bulbs offer a tiny example of governance lubricating private pockets. The same thing happens on a much bigger scale with the Central government and major industrial houses. If this government is to inspire more confidence than its predecessors, it must break the linkage either through substantial state funding of elections or by legitimizing and controlling public donations to political parties. The phenomenon of more and more wealthy legislators, according to their own declared returns, needs explaining.
It's in Modi's own interest to strengthen his credibility by rebutting allegations. Anand Sharma's demand for the names of all those who made investments of over Rs 5 lakh in gold, foreign exchange and bonds in the 20 days before demonetization is especially relevant in light of income tax data showing that only 6 per cent of undisclosed assets is in cash. The emotional and polemical aspects of the statement the Congress released last Monday need not detain us. But three points have a bearing on demonetization. They deserve a response not because Congress is better than other parties - in many respects it's probably worse - but because the government must be above suspicion.
First, the All India Congress Committee's claim that a crore of rupees was deposited in the BJP's account in a Calcutta bank on the very day demonetization was announced. Second, its charge that deposits in scheduled banks soared by Rs 5,88,600 crore between August and September this year. Third, the accusation that the National Democratic Alliance government facilitated the flight of capital by increasing the amount of money an Indian can send overseas annually from $75,000 to $1,25,000 and then to $2,50,000. There are probably perfectly simple explanations for these charges. They need to be set out to dispel suspicions of crony capitalism which is only another name for what Chakravarthi Rajagopalachari dubbed "the Licence/Permit Raj".
In the absence of clarification, nothing and nobody will be trusted, not even Wealth-X's seemingly comforting finding that rich Indians are among the world's most generous. The organization found that India's 7,800 "ultra high net worth individuals" who collectively owned $935 billion in personal assets between 2010 and 2013 donated 10.3 per cent of their overall wealth to charities. One cannot but wonder how many of these charities were tax dodges.

On the evening of November 8, I had just reached Mumbai when I heard the news from my wife that 500 and 1,000 rupee notes will no longer be legal tender from the next day. I usually do not carry cash but since I was travelling I had withdrawn four 500 rupee notes from the ATM in case I needed cash. So, here I was, in Mumbai with a wallet whose only value lay in the credit cards in it. Luckily for me, I did not have to use any cash in Mumbai and reached home three days later without any adverse impact because of demonetization. Actually, this demonetization did not affect our household at all since our reason for using cash is because we cannot pay by credit card or cheque. Obviously, this means that all our expenditure in cash occurs when we are buying things, or services, that add up to less than 500 in total.
The government has two stated policy goals: to catch people with black money and to get rid of fake notes in circulation. People have criticized the government's move on three major fronts. The first set of criticisms involves the policy goals: (a) only about 20 per cent of black money is held in cash, the rest in property and other assets like gold (b) the estimated fake notes constitute only 0.025 per cent of the total budget of close to 20,000 billion, that is five billion, a pittance (according to a study by the Indian Statistical Institute, Calcutta). The second criticism is that while this may catch or destroy some of the black money accumulated in the past, it does not do anything to stop corruption in the future. Indeed, the introduction of the new 2,000 rupee note, something the government announced along with the demonetization drive, will make it easier to store black money. The suitcase can now carry twice the amount that 1,000 rupee notes could. And, finally, the aam aadmi and aam aurat have been made to go through a lot of pain to convert their current notes into the new ones. Let me delve a bit deeper into these criticisms.
The total size of the black economy, as reported by the chief economist of SBI in a business daily, is estimated at 45,000 billion rupees. If 20 per cent of this is held in cash, as suggested by the critics of this policy, this works out to 9,000 billion rupees. In 1978, when 1,000, 5,000 and 10,000 rupee notes were demonetized, 25 per cent of the notes in circulation did not come back. The current estimate of 20 per cent is actually less than what we had in our last experience with demonetization. Even then, reducing the size of the black economy by 9,000 billion rupees cannot be a bad idea.
Actually, the impact on the size of the black economy will have to be more than this. Holding the black money in property and other real assets is a way to hedge against inflation. But this works only if there are people with black money. Property and assets generated by black money maintain their value only if there are people with enough black money to exchange these for cash. If there are only white purchasers available, the price of property will take a beating and this, too, will shrink the size of the black economy. This was evident in the overnight (closing price on November 8 and opening price on November 9) fall in the price of real-estate stocks. Indeed, according to some reports attributed to the Estate Agents Association of India, one could see a 30 per cent fall in real estate prices. This means more houses will be constructed for people to live in, rather than for investment purposes only, leading to a fall in tenancy rates too.
The ISI estimate of five billion rupees worth of fake currency is negligible in reference to the total size of the Indian economy. This has led many critics of demonetization to describe as hogwash the government's stated goal of removing the fake currency. However, if one believes that a significant part of the fake currency is used to fund terrorism, then this is not a small amount. It is not the total amount but the use being made of the fake notes that is alarming and must be sorted out.
To address the second criticism, one must appreciate the incentive that the government is giving to those who do not want to exchange but deposit their money in the bank. There are enough instances of poor people hoarding their money in cash and not using savings bank accounts. The new policy says that one can deposit as much money as they want into one's bank account provided one can explain how one obtained it and this does not constitute under-reported, or misreported, income. This will encourage poor people to start banking practices. While the Jan Dhan programme created the feasibility of opening bank accounts for the poor, the use of bank accounts by the poor needed a behavioural change in them and this change has been induced by this policy. Remember, these are the same people who accepted prepaid phone payments and have taken to Paytm. To think that they will not be able to handle banking because of illiteracy is elitist. They do not want to go to the bank because bankers treat them badly and with more poor people being forced into banks, bankers will change their behaviour towards them.
More people with bank accounts create a platform for the move towards a cashless economy. A study carried out by the India Development Foundation in 2011 investigated the challenges faced in India in moving towards a cashless economy. This was based on a survey of businesses and consumers who used cash in their daily transactions. The study recommended a number of steps to move India towards a cashless economy. These were based on the so-called MIN approach - mandatory, incentives and network. The essential first step is inclusive banking. The Jan Dhan, as well as the current drive, are incentives to enter the banking system. The DBT (direct benefit transfer) is a mandatory instrument. As more and more people become part of this system, the network effect automatically develops. And that reduces transaction costs and transaction hassles, encouraging more people to use cashless transactions. It is always more difficult to be corrupt in a cashless economy for transactions in such economies tend to leave behind a digital trail.
Finally, there is the criticism that this has adversely affected the informal sector. A large part of the informal sector is unbanked simply because many of the people who drive the informal sector are also those who evade taxes. Think of the small businessman who does not allow credit-card payments, the doctor or lawyer or private tutor who takes fees in cash, and the labour contractor who pays the daily labourer. It would be interesting to know which daily labourer earns 500 or 1,000 rupees a day. They usually do not deal in 500 or 1,000 rupee notes on a daily basis. The same applies to your corner grocery store or the vegetable vendor who comes to your house. Yes, they have a lot of hundred rupee notes but these are all still valid.
There is, however, a big lacuna that still needs to be addressed. All the poor people who are being induced to practise banking must also have the non-cash instruments with them. The government must now ensure that all those with bank accounts possess credit or debit cards. The poor do not usually default on their loans, the Vijay Mallyas do.

The people have spoken. Democracy has bared its fangs. The new world that stirs in the dying embers of 2016 is a product of the populist, anti-elite and anti-establishment outcome of public opinion tests in India, Britain and the United States of America. India spoke earlier than the others but harks back to the same roots for legitimacy as the Brexit vote and Donald Trump's elevation. Nothing could be more convenient for those who sanctify Vox Populi as Vox Dei to shatter the existing world to bits and remould it nearer to the heart's desire. The gutter was Napoleon's euphemism for the multitude when he famously claimed to have found the crown of France lying there.
Responding to the multitude is a democratic obligation. But recent experience indicates this means responding to the lowest common denominator in an idiom that appeals most to the illiterate and uninformed. Not for nothing does the Greek demokratía literally mean "rule of the commoners". Hence, the large part that mockery and mimicry plays in political speeches. Voters flock to meetings not to be enlightened through reasoned dialogue but to be entertained with body gestures, tonal variations and comic acts that have them in splits of laughter. The performer becomes doubly popular if he fulfils the yearning for some form of democratic dictatorship that will again ensure trains run on time. Unsuspected by most people, official patronage has built up a small but solid phalanx of courtiers to propagate the view that what John Adams, the second president of the US, called the "tyranny of the majority" is both logical and desirable. Abraham Lincoln's "government of the people, by the people, and for the people" has been reduced to Oscar Wilde's "bludgeoning of the people by the people for the people".
Every nation gets the government it deserves. Ironically, the French diplomat-philosopher author of that phrase coined another aphorism that seems peculiarly apposite to the present condition: "False opinions are like false money, struck first of all by guilty men and thereafter circulated by honest people who perpetuate the crime without knowing what they are doing." The prime minister declared in Dehradun that demonetization had in one stroke destroyed fake notes, terrorism, human trafficking and the drugs mafia. If true, that would mean 2017 will be clean as a whistle. However, much depends on exactly how much of the Rs 14 lakh crore, out of Rs 15.4 lakh crore said to have been circulating in Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes, deposited in banks was spurious. If the surrendered Rs 14 lakh crore was all in genuine notes, then demonetization has achieved nothing save headache and hardship for almost everyone, intense dislocation of the system, and vast expense. At the same time, reports of seized stacks of new Rs 2,000 notes suggest one of two conclusions. Either the counterfeiters are working overtime to replenish hoards with or without the connivance of official agencies, or the authorities have no idea of the channels into which real money is pumped and have again made fools of themselves - and inflicted agony on everyone else - by seizing legitimate savings in valid currency. There need not be any direct link between demonetization and the arrest of a chief secretary in South India or a businessman in Calcutta. Normal vigilance could have achieved both, providing they are guilty as charged.
The reported public enthusiasm for demonetization, which is seen as cutting the rich down to size although the rich don't hoard their wealth in Rs 1,000 and Rs 500 notes, links it to Brexit and Trump. Leaving aside doubtful reports of Queen Elizabeth secretly supporting Brexit, Britain's June 23 vote was to some extent a class thing. Most people who wanted to remain in the European Union valued the services of Polish plumbers and other East European mechanics and tradespeople whom they never met socially. But lower middle and working class people, especially in the northern provinces, feared competition for jobs, houses and educational and medical facilities. Normally they would have no hope of influencing policy. But the referendum gave them a voice. It also enabled Nigel Farage ("I want my country BACK!") of the United Kingdom Independence Party to exploit class and cultural fears. His party's triumph strengthens the view that democracy encourages the majority to decide things about which the majority is ignorant. Based on limited personal experience, voters imagined that by leaving the EU, Britain would be able to (quoting a former prime minister) "put the 'Great' back into Great Britain". A cruel awakening may await the many as, through no fault of her own, Theresa May grapples with an impossible task.
Across the Atlantic, Trump played similarly on frustration, aspiration and sentiment in America's one-time Manufacturing Belt, which became the Rust Belt when prosperity and population fled, towns stagnated and the powerful industrial sector started shrinking. Voters were taken with Trump's electoral promises to make Mexico pay for a "great, great wall" along the border, restrict Syrian refugees, deport 11 million immigrants, ban the entry of Muslims, "bomb the s**t out of" the so-called Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, bring back jobs, and introduce a series of rigorous measures. Most would not have known that his campaign reflected the white supremacist creed that Richard Spencer, president of a white nationalist think-tank, called the "alternative Right". It was to them a recipe for regeneration. Hope is the oxygen for democracy, and Trump's rhetoric ladled out hope in ample measure.
The common factor is nationalism, which General de Gaulle distinguished from patriotism. The latter, he said, "is when love of your own people comes first" while nationalism is "when hate for people other than your own comes first". This is true not just of India, Britain and the US but also continental European countries where also ultra-nationalistic parties feed on the majority's sense of deprivation. Crimes against Muslims and Jews increased by more than 50 per cent in Austria in the last year under the influence of the Freedom Party, founded by a Nazi SS general, which Vienna's mayor calls the "xenophobic face of Austria". The US Southern Poverty Law Centre counted 867 cases of hateful harassment or intimidation in the 10 days after Trump's election, following a year when, according to the US attorney-general, crimes against Muslims alone (not against Jews, African Americans and gays) shot up by 67 per cent. Hate crimes in Britain rose by 41 per cent post-Brexit.
The National Crime Records Bureau's finding of a 44 per cent rise in attacks against Dalits may not take fully into account either anti-Muslim acts or criminals masquerading as gau rakshaks, ghar wapsi bullying or sangh parivar rampaging. A series of governmental acts of omission and commission (not appointing a lokayukta or making the national anthem mandatory on trivial occasions) suggests the emergence of a State-approved code of behaviour. Suspicions of a sectarian identity are further reinforced by a list of appointments (the latest being that of Delhi's lieutenant-governor) of people connected with institutions like the Vivekananda International Foundation whose promise to fight "the threats posed by the demographic invasion from Bangladesh" recalls the harangues of Balraj Madhok who almost single-handedly kept the Jana Sangh flag flying for many years until the present, more accomplished and resourceful, leadership emerged.
The multitude might lap up this shift from the secular tolerance the Constitution envisaged, but it leaves little scope for the "freedom to doubt, disagree and dispute" that Pranab Mukherjee upheld on Thursday as an "essential pillar of democracy." It is ochlocracy or disguised mob rule that the ancient Greeks bracketed with tyranny and oligarchy as one of the bad forms of government. The Supreme Court's 1973 Kesavananda Bharati ruling can protect the basic structure doctrine of the Constitution, but probably not how it is interpreted and operated.

A distinguished Ugandan social scientist of Indian origin,whom I happened to meet earlier this month at an academic conference, told me that Narendra Modi's demonetization reminded him of the fiat in 1972 of the Ugandan dictator, Idi Amin, that all Asians should quit Uganda within a period of three months. His analogy, of course, would be considered inapposite for an obvious reason: expelling people from their places of domicile, as Amin did, is certainly a more inhumane act than snatching away people's purchasing power as has happened in India; and this remains true, even when the victims in the former case are relatively more affluent compared to those in the latter case, and number only a few thousand, compared to crores in the latter case. But his analogy is apt in another sense: both fiats are instances of extreme unreason.
In fact, in the scale of unreason, Modi's demonetization even exceeds Amin's expulsion of persons of Indian origin from Uganda. Ethnic Indians did, after all, occupy a privileged position in the Ugandan society of that time, with scant regard for the black majority; and this majority did resent the privileges of the ethnic Indians, and blamed them, not altogether without reason, for the perpetuation of its own poverty. What Amin offered was an inhumane and untenable solution to this problem, but apparently a solution of sorts nevertheless. Demonetization, on the other hand, is a complete non-solution to the problem it supposedly addresses. If Amin's was an untenable and extremely inhumane solution to the problem it addressed, Modi's is a complete non-solution to the problem it addresses; and this non-solution is also inhumane in addition, and hence constitutes an even greater act of unreason.
How much of a non-solution demonetization was, even at the time it was originally introduced, is now clear from the data supplied by the government itself. In round figures, almost 12 lakh crore of old notes have now been exchanged for new ones, or come into banks as deposits; and according to the submission of the attorney general, Mukul Rohatgi, before the Supreme Court, the government believes that at least 1 lakh crore more of old notes will come in before the December 30 deadline. Taking the total value of the demonetized currency to be approximately Rs 15 lakh crore, this means that almost 90 per cent of the demonetized currency would have entered the ambit of the banks before the deadline.
In fact, the amount of non-returned currency when the deadline ends is unlikely to exceed Rs 1 lakh crore. Since not all of it necessarily would be in the black economy, this means that only a fraction of this sum, that is, just a few thousand crore, would have got "disabled" in the "black" economy. The size of this economy being at least a quarter of the "white" economy, with a gross domestic product of its own that accordingly is in excess of Rs 35 lakh crore, the extinction of a few thousand crore of cash holdings within it, if at all that happens, does not constitute even a pinprick for the black economy.
It must not be thought, in this context, that the government had the right idea on how to tackle the "black" economy, but was simply unable to implement this idea properly; and that it is this inability which underlies its lack of success in crippling the black economy. On the contrary, its idea itself was unfounded in reality from the very beginning.
Its basic assumption in demonetizing 500 and 1000 rupee notes was that the "black economy" held huge amounts of such notes, and that since this economy would not dare to come to banks for exchanging or depositing them, demonetization would deal it a crippling blow. This assumption itself, however, was completely wrong. The fact that Rs 12 lakh crore has already visited the banking system suggests that the bulk of the now-demonetized currency was actually held in the white economy, and not in the black economy; or, alternatively, it could move freely between the two economies. From the beginning, therefore, what the government was embarking on was a non-solution to the problem of the black economy, a non-solution for the implementation of which it has relentlessly attacked the common people and brought ruin to their economy.
Even this mistaken assumption of the government, namely that a huge amount of currency is stored in the black economy, cannot just be explained away as an error of assessment. Virtually all professional economists of the country, cutting across ideological lines, have been saying from day one that the assumption that there are huge cash-hoardings in the black economy in the form of high-denomination notes is wrong. (I am referring here not to government economists or those employed by corporate entities, which are either beneficiaries from demonetization or wish to curry favour with the government.)
The economists have been saying this on the basis of plain common sense, not because they have any privileged access to data. For the government, which does have privileged access to an enormous mass of data, to proceed on an assumption that is so ludicrous that economists as diverse as Amartya Sen, Manmohan Singh, Govind Rao, Arun Kumar, Utsa Patnaik, Kaushik Basu and Jayati Ghosh are all agreed upon its ludicrousness, is indicative of the unreason I mentioned earlier. Furthermore, to bring acute distress to millions of common people and to cripple the economy because of sheer adherence to this assumption betrays a degree of extreme unreason that exceeds even what Idi Amin had shown in 1972.
Besides, Idi Amin had been less inflexible than Modi. His original diktat had been to expel all persons of Indian origin, no matter what their citizenship, including even Ugandan citizens of Indian origin. When the absurdity of this diktat, which sought to expel a country's own citizens from within its boundaries, had been brought home to Amin by an international hue and cry over it, he had rescinded it, confining the expulsion order only to those ethnic Indians who held British, Indian, Pakistani, or Bangladeshi passports. Modi, however, is impervious to all criticism. The question of rescinding any diktat does not arise for him; on the contrary, anyone criticizing the diktat is branded by him and his colleagues as being soft on black money operators.
An ominous hint of this inflexibility has been given recently by Mukul Rohatgi in a remark he made before the Supreme Court. Against the Rs 12 lakh crore of old notes that have come into the banks, the government has till now printed only Rs 4.2 lakh crore of new notes. When it was suggested that at this rate months will elapse before the old notes can be replaced by new ones, Rohatgi reportedly said that the government did not intend to replace all old notes by new ones, and that it deliberately wished to retain a shortage of notes in order to make people adopt cashless ways of settling transactions.
In other words, the difficulties that people have been facing owing to the shortage of cash are going to persist, even after Modi's famous fifty days are over, and even after the six months that most others see as the minimum period required for the restoration of normalcy are over. Normalcy it seems will never again be restored, unless people shift towards a cashless economy.
This is nothing short of holding a gun to people's heads to force them towards cashless transactions. Whether a government, and the Reserve Bank of India owned by it, can default on an IOU of the RBI (which every, except the one-rupee note, is) and force people to accept some other asset instead, is a moot point in legal terms. True, the government has interfered in the past with the people's asset preference, but these have invariably been specific cases, such as land acquisition for industrial or infrastructure projects, and have made use of enabling parliamentary legislation. To have the executive taking unilateral decisions of its own on what kind of assets the people should hold, whether they should hold cash or not, whether they should settle their transactions with cash or with Paytm, is unacceptable in a democracy.
An individual must have the right to choose how he or she settles transactions, and any interference with this right should only be permissible under laws enacted by the legislature for specific well-defined reasons. Any arbitrary interference by the executive in the asset preferences of the people, without parliamentary sanction, is an assault on democracy.
This is, however, precisely what Modi is attempting. It amounts, as Amartya Sen put it, to an act of "despotism". It is a pursuit of unreason reminiscent of Idi Amin, and must be resisted if we are to preserve democracy in the country.
